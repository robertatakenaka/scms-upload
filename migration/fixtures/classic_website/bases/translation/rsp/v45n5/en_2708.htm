<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To analyze resource allocation for pharmaceutical procurement by federative 
  entities in the Brazilian Unified Health System.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> The amounts allocated to purchase pharmaceuticals during 2009 
  in two information systems were analyzed: <i>Siga Brasil</i> (Follow Brazil) 
  for national data and <i>Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Or&ccedil;amentos 
  P&uacute;blicos em Sa&uacute;de</i> (Information System on Public Health Budgets) 
  for states, the Federal District and municipalities data. <i>Per capita</i> 
  spending and the mean and median spending were calculated by municipalities, 
  according to region and population size. The Spearman correlation coefficient 
  was calculated for some variables. The statistical analysis included tests of 
  normality and multiple comparisons for differences between groups.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> In 2009 the total amount spent by the three spheres of government 
  for purchase of medicines was approximately R$ 8.9 billion. States and the Federal 
  District were the main players, accounting for 47.1% of the total amount spent 
  in the health system. Some states had <i>per capita</i> spending well above 
  the mean (R$ 22.00 per resident/year) and the median (R$ 17.00 per resident/year). 
  There were differences in municipal spending by region. The mean <i>per capita</i> 
  expenditure of municipalities with less than 5,000 residents was 3.9 times that 
  of municipalities with over 500,000 residents. Municipalities with less than 
  10,000 residents had higher <i>per capita</i> spending than other municipalities.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Economic aspects such as the scale of procurement and bargaining 
  power may explain differences in <i>per capita</i> spending between federal 
  entities, especially among municipalities. The study indicates inefficiencies 
  in the use of financial resources to procure medicines in the Brazilian Unified 
  Health System.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJETIVO:</b> 
  Analizar la aplicaci&oacute;n directa de recursos financieros por los entes 
  federados para la adquisici&oacute;n de medicamentos en el Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Salud.<br>
  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS:</b> Se levantaron los valores ubicados en aplicaciones directas 
  para la adquisici&oacute;n de medicamentos en el a&ntilde;o de 2009 en dos sistemas 
  de informaci&oacute;n: Siga Brasil del Senado Federal (para la Uni&oacute;n) 
  y Sistema de Informaciones sobre Presupuestos P&uacute;blicos en Salud (para 
  estados, Distrito Federal y municipios). Se calcul&oacute; el gasto <i>per capita</i> 
  con medicamentos, as&iacute; como el promedio y mediana del gasto de municipios 
  por Regi&oacute;n y por categor&iacute;a de tama&ntilde;o de poblaci&oacute;n. 
  El coeficiente de Spearman fue calculado para algunas variables definidas. El 
  an&aacute;lisis estad&iacute;stico incluy&oacute; pruebas de normalidad para 
  los datos y de comparaci&oacute;n m&uacute;ltiple para diferencias entre grupos.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS:</b> En 2009 el valor total liquidado para la adquisici&oacute;n 
  de medicamentos por las tres esferas de gobierno en el Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Salud fue de US$ 4,9 billones. Estados y el Distrito Federal fueron los principales 
  ejecutores, siendo responsables por 47,1% del valor total liquidado en el Sistema 
  &Uacute;nico de Salud. Algunos estados tuvieron gasto <i>per capita</i> muy 
  por encima del promedio (US$ 12,15 hab/a&ntilde;o) y de la mediana (US$ 9,39 
  hab/a&ntilde;o). Hubo diferencia en el gasto de municipios por regi&oacute;n 
  y se observ&oacute; que el promedio del gasto <i>per capita</i> de los que tienen 
  hasta 5 mil habitantes fue 3,9 veces mayor que el de los municipios con m&aacute;s 
  de 500 mil habitantes. Municipios con hasta 10 mil habitantes tuvieron un gasto 
  <i>per capita</i> mayor que los dem&aacute;s municipios.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES:</b> Aspectos econ&oacute;micos tales como escala de adquisici&oacute;n 
  de medicamentos y poder de negociaci&oacute;n pueden explicar las diferencias 
  de gasto <i>per capita</i> entre los entes federados, especialmente los municipios. 
  El estudio resalta las ineficiencias en las aplicaciones de recursos financieros 
  para la adquisici&oacute;n de medicamentos en el Sistema &Uacute;nico de Salud.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For many years, 
  governments around the world have contended with the evolving challenge of managing 
  the allocation of resources for health services, while several factors have 
  contributed to increased spending.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this context, 
  expenditures on medicine have increased in various countries. In Canada <i>per 
  capita</i> spending on solid oral prescriptions increased 10% per year from 
  1998 to 2004, in the majority of provinces, faster than economic growth over 
  the same time period.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This situation 
  has stimulated measures to control costs. In Europe, price policies were established 
  in the 1980s and 1990s, including price controls, the establishment of reference 
  pricing and control of profits.<sup>2,6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these countries, 
  price controls have taken direct and indirect forms. Policies classified as 
  direct control include negotiation of prices with suppliers, establishment of 
  price ceilings, performance of international comparisons and price cuts or freezes. 
  Indirect control has been implemented by regulating profits, establishment of 
  a reference price and use of a price index.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Impact evaluations 
  of these policies have found decreased government expenditures immediatly following 
  implementation and shown that direct price control measures are more effective.<sup>1,8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil there 
  has also been a substantial increase in total spending on medicines, as indicated 
  by spending by the Ministry of Health on the acquisition of antiretrovirals 
  and medicines on the Specialized Component on Pharmaceutical Assistance.<sup>11</sup> 
  Economic regulations were instituted in 2003 with the creation of the Regulatory 
  Council of the Pharmaceutical Market (<i>C&acirc;mara de Regula&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  do Mercado de Medicamentos</i>, CMED), responsible for approving prices for 
  market entry and the annual readjustment of pharmaceutical products on the market.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 2007, CMED 
  also began regulating the price of sales to the government for medicines in 
  the list recommended by clinical protocols from the Ministry of Health. The 
  Price Adequacy Coefficient was created, which consists of an amount to be discounted 
  from the manufacture price of these medicines (currently 22.85%), instituting 
  the maximum sale price to the government. It is a minimum mandatory discount 
  that should be applied by distributors and/or laboratories when they sell to 
  the public sector.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Brazilian 
  Unified Health System (<i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de,</i> SUS), procurement 
  of medicines are performed autonomously by the Federal Union, 5,564 municipalities, 
  26 states and the Federal District, in addition to hospitals under indirect 
  public administration. The complexity of the administrative structure necessitates 
  an analysis of expenditures for medicines by each federal entity, so that potential 
  problems can be monitored and policies formulated to improve the efficient use 
  of public resources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study objective 
  was to analyze the direct use of financial resources by federal entities in 
  the acquisition of medicines in SUS.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Methods</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amount liquidated<a name="tope"></a><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a> 
  in the acquisition of medicines by the federal government in 2009 was obtained 
  from the Follow Brazil (<i>Siga Brazil</i>) system, which makes the federal 
  budget available on an internet website from the Federal Senate.<a name="topf"></a><a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> 
  The following budget items of the federal Union are directly associated with 
  acquisition of medicines: a) 6031; b) 4295; c) 6142; d) 20AE; e) 4368; f) 4370; 
  g) 4705 and h) 20BA. For each of these budget items, the only values used were 
  extracted by the direct application mode.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To calculate <i>per 
  capita</i> spending by the Union on medicines, the sum of the values liquidated 
  in direct applications for these items was divided by the total estimated population 
  of Brazil on 1 July 2009, available from the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
  and Statistics (<i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica,</i> 
  IBGE).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amounts liquidated 
  by states, the Federal District and municipalities for acquisition of medicines 
  were extracted from the Information System about Public Health Budgets (<i>Sistema 
  de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Or&ccedil;amentos P&uacute;blicos em Sa&uacute;de</i>, 
  SIOPS).<a name="topg"></a><a href="#backg"><sup>g</sup></a> The accounting classifications 
  used were 3.3.3.90.30.09.00 and 3.3.3.90.32.03.01. The sum of the two values 
  obtained by each accounting classification corresponds to the total expenditure 
  for each entity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Per capita</i> 
  spending by states, the Federal District and municipalities on medicines was 
  obtained by dividing the total cost of medicines in each federative entity by 
  its respective population, estimated for July 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 by the IBGE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Median and mean 
  per capita disbursements were calculated for each municipality, according to 
  geographical region and population size: less than 5,000 residents; 5,001 to 
  10,000; 10,001 to 20,000; 20,001 to 50,000, 50,001 to 100,000; 100,001 to 500,000 
  and more than 500,000 residents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data was obtained 
  on the number of consultations, to investigate the association between number 
  of visits per resident and spending on medicines per resident, using the website 
  from the SUS Informatics Department (DATASUS).<a name="toph"></a><a href="#backh"><sup>h</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Spearman linear 
  coefficient correlation was calculated for the following municipal variables: 
  a) visits per resident per year and expenses on medicines per person per year; 
  b) visits per resident older than 40 years per year and expenses on medicines 
  per resident per year; and c) population and spending on medicines per resident 
  per year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical analysis 
  was performed with R (version 2.6.2) and the following tests were performed: 
  Lillefors test for normality; Grubbs test for outliers; Shapiro-Wilk test for 
  normality; Kruskal-Wallis for differences between groups; and multiple compairson 
  for differences between groups.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Results</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2708t01.htm">Table</a> 
  shows that in 2009 the total value liquidated for acquisition of medicines by 
  the three spheres of government in SUS was 8.9 billion reais, approximately 
  4.9 billion US dollars, according to the total declared by states and municipalities 
  in SIOPS until the date of data collection (6/16/2010).<a name="topi"></a><a href="#backi"><sup>i</sup></a> 
  This value does not include expenditures by all states and municipalities, since 
  during the period analyzed three states (Esp&iacute;rito Santo, Paran&aacute; 
  e Pernambuco) and 152 municipalities lacked information. Direct disbursements 
  by the Union totaled 12.33 reais/resident/year in 2009.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regards to the 
  percentage of participation by federative entities in direct disbursements for 
  the acquisition of medicines, the states and Federal District were the main 
  players in volume of resources, responsible for 47.1% of the total value liquidated 
  in SUS. They were followed by the Union with 26.5% and municipalities with 26.4%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some states had 
  <i>per capita</i> spending far above the mean (22.00 reais per resident/year) 
  and median (17.00 reais per resident/year), suggesting the presence of outliers 
  (inconsistent values) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2708f01.jpg">Figure 1</a>). Use of 
  the Lillefors test (D=0.1646, p=0.09184) indicated that the hypothesis of a 
  normal distribution should not be rejected, and the Grubbs test (D=0.4206, p&lt;0.001) 
  indicated that the extreme values, for Amap&aacute; and the Federal District, 
  did not happen randomly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean and median 
  <i>per capita</i> spending on medicines by municipalities, according to Region, 
  showed that municipalities in the North and South states were different than 
  states in the Northeast and Southeast (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>). According 
  to the Shapiro-Wilk test, the hypothesis of normality can be rejected for each 
  region: North, W = 0.4253 and p &lt; 0.0001; Northeast, W = 0.6792 and p &lt; 
  0.0001; South, W = 0.7537 and p &lt; 0.0001; Southeast, W = 0.1079 and p &lt; 
  0.0001 and Central-West, W = 0.5809 and p &lt; 0.0001. Therefore, since the 
  observations cannot be described as resulting from a Gaussian distribution, 
  non-parametric tests for comparisons between groups should be performed. In 
  this case, the Kruskal-Wallis test rejected the hypothesis that the groups are 
  similar and that, at least, one group is different than the others (207.0103, 
  4 degrees of freedom; p&lt;0.001).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The multiple comparison 
  test performed after the Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the Central-West 
  has statistically different expenditures than the North, Northeast and Southeast 
  regions. The North differs than the South but not from the Northeast and Southeast 
  regions. <i>Per capita</i> spending by the Southeast and Northeast regions are 
  similar, although they are different than the South region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In analyzing the 
  mean and median <i>per capita</i> direct disbursements by municipalities, stratified 
  by population size, we verify that the mean <i>per capita</i> spending of municipalities 
  smaller than 5,000 residents is 3.9 times greater than municipalities with more 
  than 500 thousand residents. Median <i>per capita</i> spending is 3.3 times 
  greater for municipalities with less than 5 thousand residents in relation to 
  those with at least 500 thousand residents (<a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The normality hypothesis 
  for spending, according to municipal size was rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk test: 
  a) less than 5,000, W = 0.7845 and p&lt;0.0001; b) 5,001 to 10,000, W = 0.5383 
  and p &lt;0.0001; c) 10,001 to 20,000, W = 0.0693 and p &lt;0.0001; d) 20,001 
  to 50,000, W = 0.7837 and p &lt;0.0001; e) 50,001 to 100,000, W = 0.6507 and 
  p &lt;0.0001; f) 10,0001 to 500,000, W = 0.3419 to p &lt;0.0001; g) more than 
  500,000 W = 0.8941 and p&lt;0.001. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that <i>per 
  capita</i> spending by small municipalities (less than 5,000 residents, or 5,001 
  to 10,000) was different than spending by the other size classes. Spending by 
  municipalities between 10,001 and 20,000 residents was equal only if compared 
  to municipal spending by municipalities with more than 500,000 residents. For 
  all the classes of municipalities with more than 20,000 residents, <i>per capita</i> 
  spending on medicines was not statistically different.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  correlation test (Spearman, R) the variables "<i>per capita</i> spending on 
  medicines" and "number of medical visits per resident" showed a statistically 
  significant positive correlation, although of a small magnitude (R=0.06377, 
  p&lt;0.001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Spearman test 
  indicated a week positive correlation (R=0.06925, p&lt;0.001) between <i>per 
  capita</i> spending and number of medical consultations per resident aged 40 
  years or more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Per capita</i> 
  spending was inversely related with municipal population (R=-0.39087, p&lt;0.001).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article presents 
  the values allocated for acquisition of medicines by the federative entities 
  in SUS, considering only direct disbursements. Therefore, financing is not discussed 
  here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The allocation 
  of 8.9 billion reais in direct disbursements for SUS medicines in 2009, does 
  not represent the full actual value due to the characteristics of SIOPS, used 
  to collect data on states and municipalities. Since the system depends on reporting 
  and is not compulsory, some states and municipalities had not provided their 
  budgets and expenses on health, including medicines, by the end of data collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, the 
  total value of direct disbursements by states and municipalities is greater 
  than presented in the <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2708t01.htm">Table</a>, and these 
  spheres of government participate more in total SUS spending for the purchase 
  of medicines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regards to direct 
  <i>per capita</i> spending by states, the values allocated by Amap&aacute;, 
  northern Brazil, (67.07 reais per resident/year) and the Federal District (66.45 
  reais per resident/year), stand far above the mean (22.00 reais per resident/year). 
  Many situations may explain these findings, including inefficient purchase of 
  medicines and misappropriation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis of mean 
  and median municipal values by region indicates differences of up to 46% among 
  these measures, showing some very discrepant municipalities in relation to other 
  municipalities of the same region. Statistical comparison of the regional differences 
  in <i>per capita</i> municipal spending (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>) reveals 
  that municipalities in the Central-West spend more than those in the Northeast 
  and Southeast and less than in the North. In addition, municipal spending in 
  the Northeast and Southeast regions are similar but different than in the South. 
  The greater difference between the mean and median in the North suggests greater 
  inequality in spending on medicines by municipalities, where many municipalities 
  have very low spending and few have very high spending. This pattern also occurs 
  in low population municipalities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inverse relationship 
  between <i>per capita</i> spending and municipal population is interesting. 
  Municipalities with population less than 5,001 residents had mean <i>per capita</i> 
  spending 3.9 times greater than municipalities with a population above 500,000 
  residents. Spending by municipalities with less than 10,001 residents is statistical 
  different than spending by the other municipal sizes. Some hypotheses were developed 
  to explain this finding. First, it was necessary to evaluate if smaller municipalities 
  produce more consultations, since a greater number of consultations could imply 
  more prescriptions and greater <i>per capita</i> spending. Second, more consultations 
  may have been performed among people 40 years of age or older in smaller municipalities, 
  this could involve more prescriptions and greater <i>per capita</i> spending 
  due to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases among this population. Third, 
  the differences could have been due to qualitative differences in the list of 
  medicines prescribed to the population. Fourth, these differences could have 
  been explained by a greater proportion of people with health plans, who did 
  not use SUS to obtain prescribed medicines, in larger municipalities. The fifth 
  hypothesis regarded economic questions, such as negotiating power and scale 
  of purchase that could mean smaller municipalities<a name="topj"></a><a href="#backj"><sup>j</sup></a> 
  pay higher prices for products due to less negotiating power and economies of 
  scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regards to the 
  first two hypotheses, the number of consultations did not interfere with the 
  differences observed in <i>per capita</i> spending by municipalities since the 
  current study found a weak and positive correlation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for the third 
  hypothesis, it can be affirmed with a high degree of confidence that the qualitative 
  variations of the medicines offered to the population are minimal, due to national 
  policy and federal financing for the acquisition of medicines available in primary 
  health care. Municipal managers have little discretionary responsibility to 
  change the items on the federal list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of 
  the fourth hypothesis, few private health plans offer medicines in Brazil. Therefore, 
  we believe that if this effect exists, it is very limited since even people 
  with health plans utilize SUS for medicines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rejection of 
  the prior hypotheses, since they do not explain or explain very little of the 
  <i>per capita</i> differences in spending, implies that the most plausible hypothesis 
  concerns differences in negotiating power and scale of purchases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact is greater 
  on smaller municipalities, since they pay higher prices due to lower negotiating 
  power and smaller quantities purchased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a need 
  to discuss the efficient use of public resources, since medicines are acquired 
  with resources from the payment of taxes by society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chalkidou et al<sup>4</sup> 
  analyzed the prices paid for the same medication by different government agencies 
  in the USA. They concluded there was no acceptable economic or social justification 
  for the large differences paid for pharmaceutical products by the federal government.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Brazilian 
  case, if the large difference in the prices paid is confirmed, the difference 
  would not be intra-governmental as in the USA and instead be intergovernmental. 
  In any case, it does not seem acceptable that public resources are used in this 
  fashion, indicating a need to adopt policies that promote efficiency in public 
  purchases by all spheres of government.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some strategies 
  have already been implemented by some state governments in Brazil. For example, 
  S&atilde;o Paulo and Minas Gerais (both in southeastern Brazil) produce medicines 
  in public pharmaceutical laboratories for supply to municiplaities.<sup>5</sup> 
  In Paran&aacute; (southern Brazil) a consortium for medicines has been established, 
  where municipalities unite to increase the scale of the purchase and negotiating 
  power over prices.<sup>5,7</sup> These strategies were considered effective 
  for the reduction of costs to acquire medicines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, these 
  measures are far from reaching all Brazilian municipalities, meaning there is 
  an urgent need to discuss policies that promote the efficient use of resources. 
  Policies can be implemented to guarantee better prices in public purchases, 
  such as the establishment of municipal consortium and the registration of prices 
  by states so that municipalities purchase at pre-registered prices under a contract.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Centralization 
  of purchases by the federal government is only justified for medicines sold 
  by one provider and/or acquired from abroad and/or have a very high per unit 
  cost. In these situations, the economic savings from centralization appears 
  to surpass logistic difficulties and cost given the extent of the national territory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another possibility 
  to guarantee efficiency includes the adoption of more ample measures that have 
  a national impact. The regulation of public purchases through a price ceiling 
  for all SUS medicines currently occurs with some medicines that have a maximum 
  sale price to the government. This policy appears to be one of the most effective 
  and least dependent on administrative attention. Nonetheless, it is necessary 
  to evaluate the impact of other policies, given that the Brazilian pharmaceutical 
  market is one of the largest in the world and SUS is a large purchaser of medications 
  for this market.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  it is critical to implement and monitor pharmaceutical policies in order to 
  regulate public purchases in Brazil. The international trend of increased spending 
  on medicines is present in Brazil, which indicates a need to adopt measures 
  to guarantee the sustainability of SUS.</font></p>
