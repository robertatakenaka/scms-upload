<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To describe socioeconomic inequalities regarding the use, expenditures and the 
  income committed to the purchase of medicines.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b> A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out with 
  1,720 adults living in the urban area of Florian&oacute;polis, Southern Brazil, 
  in 2009. Cluster sampling was adopted and census tracts were the primary sampling 
  units. Use of medicines and the expenditures incurred in their purchase in the 
  past 30 days were investigated through interviews. Use, expenditures and the 
  income committed concerning medicines were analyzed according to <i>per capita</i> 
  family income, self-reported skin color, age and sex, adjusting for the complex 
  sample.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b> The prevalence of medicine use was 76.5% (95%CI: 73.8; 79.3), 
  higher among women and in older individuals. The mean expenditure on medicine 
  was R$ 46.70, with higher values among women, whites, older individuals and 
  among richer people. While 3.1% of the richest committed more than 15% of their 
  income to purchasing medicine, that figure reached 9.6% in the poorest group. 
  The proportion of people that had to buy medicines after an unsuccessful attempt 
  to obtain them in the public health system was higher among the poor (11.0%), 
  women (10.2%) and the elderly (11.1%). A large part of the adults bought medicines 
  contained in the National List of Essential Medicines (19.9%) or in the Municipal 
  List of Essential Medicines (28.6%), with significant differences according 
  to gender, age and income.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b> There is socioeconomic, age and gender inequality in the 
  income committed to the purchase of medicines, with worse conditions for the 
  poor, older individuals and women.</font></p>

  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS: </b> Estudio transversal de base poblacional con 1.720 adultos 
  de &aacute;rea urbana de Florian&oacute;polis, Sur de Brasil en 2009. Se realiz&oacute; 
  la selecci&oacute;n de la muestra por conglomerados y las unidades primarias 
  fueron los sectores censitarios. Se investig&oacute; el uso de medicamentos 
  y los gastos con su compra en los 30 d&iacute;as anteriores, por medio de entrevista. 
  Uso, gasto y comprometimiento de renta debido a medicamentos fueron analizados 
  seg&uacute;n la renta familiar <i>per capita,</i> el color de la piel auto-referida, 
  edad y el sexo de los individuos, ajustado para muestra compleja.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS: </b> La prevalencia del uso de medicamentos fue de 76,5% (IC95%:73,8;79,3), 
  mayor entre las mujeres y en aquellos con edad avanzada. El promedio de gastos 
  con medicamentos fue igual a R$ 46,70, con valores m&aacute;s elevados entre 
  las mujeres, los blancos, los de edad m&aacute;s elevada y entre los m&aacute;s 
  ricos. Mientras que 3,1% de los m&aacute;s ricos comprometieron m&aacute;s de 
  15% de sus rendimientos en la compra de medicamentos, ese valor lleg&oacute; 
  a 9,6% en los m&aacute;s pobres. La proporci&oacute;n de personas que tuvieron 
  que comprar medicamentos posterior al intento fracasado de obtenerlos por el 
  Sistema &Uacute;nico de Salud fue mayor entre los m&aacute;s pobres (11,0%), 
  mujeres (10,2%) y en aquellos con edad avanzada (11,1%). Gran parte de los adultos 
  compr&oacute; medicamentos ubicados en la Relaci&oacute;n Nacional de Medicamentos 
  Esenciales (19,9%) o en la Relaci&oacute;n Municipal de Medicamentos Esenciales 
  (28,6%), con diferencias significativas seg&uacute;n sexo, edad y renta.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES: </b> Existe desigualdad socioecon&oacute;mica, de edad y de 
  g&eacute;nero en el comprometimiento de renta con la compra de medicamentos, 
  con peores condiciones para los m&aacute;s pobres, los de edad avanzada y para 
  las mujeres.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian health 
  system has been legally universal, equitable and integral since the end of the 
  1980s. The <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS - National Health 
  System), which was created in Brazil in 1990, has incorporated actions to consolidate 
  its principles and guidelines, such as the guarantee of integral therapeutic 
  assistance, including pharmaceutical assistance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil is one of 
  the few countries in which free access to essential medicines is a right of 
  the citizens, materialized by means of policies and strategies, like <i>Rela&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Nacional de Medicamentos Essenciais</i> (RENAME - National List of Essential 
  Medicines) and <i>Rela&ccedil;&atilde;o Municipal de Medicamentos Essenciais</i> 
  (REMUME - Municipal List of Essential Medicines).<sup>4</sup> Generic drugs 
  were introduced in Brazil in 1999 to reduce the price of medicines and facilitate 
  the access of the entire population to these inputs. In 2004, the federal government 
  launched <i>Programa Farm&aacute;cia Popular</i> (Popular Drugstore Program), 
  which aims to reduce the impact of medicines' prices on the family budget based 
  on the co-payment system, in which the public power pays approximately 90% of 
  the medicine's value and the citizen pays directly the rest.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the advancements 
  in the sector's public policies, they do not reach a large part of the population, 
  mainly concerning the rational use of medicines, both in the private market 
  and in the public sector.<sup>7</sup> The global investment in health (public 
  and private expenditures) was equivalent to 7.6% of the Brazilian gross domestic 
  product in 2003,<sup>19</sup> showing a lower participation of the public sector 
  in this proportion (45.3%), a value that is close to the one observed in countries 
  with non-universal health systems.<sup>19</sup> The low public investment in 
  health causes higher private expenditures in this sector, including drug expenditures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drug expenditure 
  represents the largest part of the private expenditures on health among the 
  poor. The medicines' weight in the total health expenditures is inversely proportional 
  to income, according to a literature review in 54 low-income countries.<sup>16</sup> 
  Similarly, medicines have had the largest share of responsibility for health 
  expenditures in Brazil, reaching approximately 47% of the total expenditures.<sup>3</sup> 
  Income committed to drug expenditure, especially when it is not planned, can 
  lead families to even greater health risks, like the reduction in the purchase 
  of food products, and make them become more susceptible to health problems, 
  or, by the economic order, make families become poorer or even indigent.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian population-based 
  studies have shown that the mean expenditure on medicines in absolute figures 
  is higher among older men<sup>12</sup> and increases as income increases.<sup>3</sup> 
  The SUS assumes the largest part of the global drug expenditures, mainly among 
  the poor, while the rich present more private expenditures.<sup>5</sup> In spite 
  of this, data from <i>Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic&iacute;lios 1998</i> 
  (National Household Sample Survey) presented more income committed to the purchase 
  of medicines among the poor, transposing differences between groups and configuring 
  it as inequity.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the 
  present study was to describe socioeconomic inequalities concerning the use, 
  expenditures and income committed to the purchase of medicines.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Methods</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cross-sectional 
  population-based study with 2,016 adults aged 20-59 years from the urban area 
  of Florian&oacute;polis (Southern Brazil), carried out between August 2009 and 
  January 2010. The study was called EpiFloripa. Florian&oacute;polis is the capital 
  city of the State of Santa Catarina. It is a medium-sized municipality, with 
  population estimated at 408,163 inhabitants in 2009.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  In the most recent national census (year 2000), Florian&oacute;polis presented 
  <i>per capita</i> income of R$ 701.42 (equivalent to US$ 354.25), Gini index 
  of 0.57 and municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) of 0.875, the highest one 
  among the Brazilian capital cities.<a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study's target 
  population corresponded to 249,530 people, equivalent to 61.1% of the total 
  population of the municipality.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parameters 
  to the final sample were: prevalence of drug expenditures of 50%, sample error 
  of four percentage points, and a 95% confidence interval. A design effect of 
  2 was used, 10% were added for possible losses or refusals and 20% to control 
  for confounding factors. This sample was enough to estimate the outcome of any 
  magnitude considering the same sample error.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two-stage sampling 
  was performed. The first stage was formed by the census tracts defined by <i>Instituto 
  Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> (IBGE - Brazilian Institute 
  of Geography and Statistics) for statistical purposes. The units of the second 
  stage were the households included in the selected census tracts. The study's 
  unit of analysis was the adult individual. All the adult inhabitants of the 
  selected households were eligible for the interview, except for institutionalized 
  individuals or those unable to answer the study's questionnaire (bedridden or 
  with some physical or mental disability).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean income 
  of the heads of households was observed in the 420 urban census tracts according 
  to the 2000 Census and the values ranged from R$ 192.80 to R$ 13,209.50. The 
  sectors were organized in an increasing income order and stratified in deciles. 
  Sixty census tracts were drawn, with systematic selection of six sectors in 
  each income decile. With a minimum of 61 households and a maximum of 810, the 
  coefficient of variation of occupied households across sectors was 55%. In order 
  to reduce it, some census tracts were merged and others were divided; thus, 
  63 census tracts were obtained with a coefficient of variation of 32%. Eighteen 
  households were systematically drawn in each of these geographical units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data collection 
  was performed by 35 female interviewers. They had completed High School and 
  were fully available to conduct the fieldwork. The Personal Digital Assistant 
  (PDA) was used to register and store data. Losses were considered adult inhabitants 
  of drawn households that were not found after at least four visits, one on a 
  weekend and another in the night period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality control 
  of the answers was performed on a weekly basis through revision and checking 
  of 15% of the interviews, selected by means of a draw in each sector. Key information 
  contained in the questionnaire was verified by telephone by the field supervisors. 
  Analyzing the agreements, the kappa value varied from 0.6 to 1.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The outcomes were 
  the use of medicines, expenditures and the income committed to the purchase 
  of them during 30 days before the interview. The socioeconomic classification 
  was performed according to the interviewees' <i>per capita</i> family income 
  (stratified in quintiles). Information on self-reported skin color was also 
  utilized (white, mixed-color, black, indigenous and yellow; the last two were 
  excluded from this analysis due to the small number of people), as well as gender 
  and age in complete years (20 to 29; 30 to 39; 40 to 49 and 50 to 59).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question that 
  guided the study was: <i>"In the last 30 days did you take any medicine?"</i>. 
  The names, dosages and pharmaceutical presentation of the medicines were asked, 
  as well as the form of acquisition (SUS; commercial drugstore; the person already 
  had it at home or was given by someone). The number of medicines used, the purchase 
  of medicines because it was not possible to obtain them from the SUS, and their 
  presence on RENAME and REMUME were analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To calculate the 
  drug expenditures, information referring to the last 30 days and self-reported 
  values described in <i>reais</i> (Brazilian currency) were used. The value of 
  the income committed to the purchase of medicines was obtained by the division 
  of the reported expenditure by the <i>per capita</i> family income. Then, the 
  quotient was multiplied by 100 and the value was expressed in the form of percentage. 
  For this calculation, 24 people who had no income were excluded. The variable 
  income commitment was categorized according to cutoff points equal to <u>&gt;</u> 
  5%, <u>&gt;</u> 10% and <u>&gt;</u> 15%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  analyses were performed using the Stata <i>svy</i> commands to correct the design 
  effect of complex samples and incorporate the sample weights. It is available 
  in the program Stata version 9.0. The analyses of use, expenditures and income 
  commitment were carried out according to income quintile, skin color, age and 
  gender. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated by means of Poisson 
  regression, considering the demographic and socioeconomic variables for the 
  outcomes: proportion of use of medicines, acquisition of at least one medicine 
  through the SUS, purchase of medicines not obtained through the SUS, expenditures 
  on medicines from RENAME and expenditures on medicines from REMUME. The socioeconomic 
  and demographic variables were adjusted among themselves in the adjusted model. 
  To test the difference between means, the Mann Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests 
  were employed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The calculation 
  of the sample was performed in EpiInfo 6.04.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Process 
  no. 351/2008).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Results</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The response rate 
  was 85.3% (n = 1,720). The mean age of the interviewees was 38 years (standard-deviation 
  - SD = 11.6) and 55.5% were women. The prevalence of medicines use during 30 
  days before the interview was 76.5%, 29% higher among women (PR: 1.29; 95% CI: 
  1.21;1.39) and 7% higher in older adults when compared to younger adults (PR: 
  1.07; 95%CI: 1.00;1.15) in the adjusted analysis. No statistically significant 
  differences were observed in the use of medicines among the income and skin 
  color strata (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t01.jpg">Table 1</a>). Approximately one 
  third of the adults who used medicines in the past 30 days used only one, approximately 
  half used two, &#188; reported the use of three and a little less than 10% used 
  four or more medicines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean expenditure 
  was R$ 46.70 (median = R$ 10.00), varying from zero to R$ 920.00. The spent 
  values were 60% higher among the women and increased according to the individuals' 
  income, approximately five times higher among the richer ones (Q5) when compared 
  to the poorer ones (Q1). Higher expenditures were observed among older people 
  (approximately three times higher in the older individuals when compared to 
  the younger ones). White individuals (70% more) and mixed-color individuals 
  (50% more) presented higher expenditures on medicines than black individuals 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t02.jpg">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The income committed 
  to the purchase of medicines was almost three times higher among the poorer 
  individuals (Q1) when compared to the richer ones (Q5). While in the first income 
  quintile people committed, on average, 7.3% of their income to the purchase 
  of medicines, in the richest quintile the proportion was of 2.7% (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a>). More income was committed among the women (90% more) and among the older 
  individuals (60% more among individuals aged 50 - 59 years compared to those 
  aged 20 - 29 years) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t02.jpg">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2653f01.htm">Figure 
  1</a> presents the prevalence of people who spent any value with the purchase 
  of medicines and the proportion of people who committed values equal to or higher 
  than 5%, 10% and 15% of their income to the purchase of medicines, according 
  to the quintiles of <i>per capita</i> family income. Approximately 70% of the 
  richer ones (Q5) committed some of their income to expenditures on medicines, 
  a proportion that is significantly higher than in the other groups (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2653f01.htm">Figure 
  1A</a>). However, the proportion of people who committed 5% or more of their 
  income to expenditures on medicines was much higher among the poorer individuals 
  (Q1) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2653f01.htm">Figure 1B</a>). This difference was 
  more significant when higher income commitments were considered. While 6.5% 
  of the richer individuals (Q5) committed 10.0% or more of their income to the 
  purchase of medicines, among the poorer ones, 14.6% presented this situation 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2653f01.htm#f1cd">Figure 1C</a>). When the focus was 
  on commitment equal to or higher than 15%, 9.6% of the poorer individuals (Q1) 
  were in this condition, compared to 3.1% of the richer individuals (Q5) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/html/en2653f01.htm#f1cd">Figure 
  1D</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t03.jpg">Table 
  3</a> presents differences related to the purchase of medicines in the SUS according 
  to gender, age, skin color and <i>per capita</i> family income. Approximately 
  one out of every five people obtained at least one medicine in the SUS, a significantly 
  higher value among the poorer individuals (PR: 6.20 95%CI 3.50;10.97), women 
  (PR: 1.56 95%CI 1.18;2.06), older individuals (PR: 1.76 95%CI 1.29;2.42) and 
  the blacks (PR: 1.44 95%CI 1.08;1.93) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t04.jpg">Table 
  4</a>). A higher proportion of women, older people and poorer individuals needed 
  to purchase medicines after trying unsuccessfully to obtain them through the 
  SUS. No difference was observed regarding skin color. A large proportion of 
  people purchased medicines that compose the lists RENAME and REMUME (19.9% and 
  28.6%, respectively), mainly women, older individuals and richer individuals 
  in the crude and adjusted analyses (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2653t04.jpg">Table 4</a>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women and older 
  individuals use more, spend more and commit more income to drug expenditures 
  compared to men and to younger people. Individuals who self-reported their skin 
  color as black presented less expenditures on medicines than white individuals. 
  An important socioeconomic inequality was observed in drug expenditures and 
  in the income committed to the purchase of medicines, i.e., the poorer the individual, 
  the higher the income committed, but the richer the individual, the higher the 
  expenditures on medicines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of medicines use was higher than the ones observed in other national studies 
  with adults, whose prevalences vary from 49.7%<sup>2</sup> to 69.9%,<sup>17</sup> 
  and the same occurs in international studies (from 36.8%<sup>13</sup> to 67.4%).<sup>11</sup> 
  The differences in prevalences may derive from differences in the analyzed age 
  groups and in the recall period. If, on the one hand, a longer recall time can 
  increase the exposure to the use of medicines, on the other hand it can increase 
  the memory bias, mainly in the population that does not use medicines in a continuous 
  way.<sup>6</sup> Furthermore, differences in the pharmaceutical policies adopted 
  in different countries may influence the behavior of medicines use and may partly 
  explain the distinct prevalences when we compare the national and international 
  panoramas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher utilization 
  of medicines among women and older individuals corroborate the findings of the 
  literature,<sup>7,9,11</sup> which also point to higher concern about health 
  and higher utilization of the health services in the female sex.<sup>10</sup> 
  It is expected that individuals are affected by a higher number of chronic diseases 
  as age advances and, consequently, use more the health services. The combination 
  of these factors directly influences the increase in the use of medicines.<sup>8</sup> 
  Additionally, the medicalization of health adopted by a large part of professionals 
  and institutions, besides health actions and programs that are specific to women, 
  like adolescents, pregnant women and puerperal women, contribute to explain 
  this scenario.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The expenditures 
  mean was higher among women and older individuals, accompanying the greater 
  use of these inputs in these groups, and white individuals spent more than black 
  individuals, similarly as found in the United States,<sup>20</sup> but the association 
  lost significance after adjustment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drug expenditures 
  were higher among the richer individuals, which suggests higher availability 
  of financial resources and also the possibility that the SUS has a more comprehensive 
  coverage among the poorer individuals, potentially minimizing the absolute expenditures 
  of this group.<a name="tope"></a><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a> The lower 
  expenditures among the poorer individuals may be explained by the expansion 
  of health programs in the SUS, like <i>Farm&aacute;cia B&aacute;sica</i> (Basic 
  Drugstore), <i>Estrat&eacute;gia da Sa&uacute;de da Fam&iacute;lia</i> (Family 
  Health Strategy) and <i>Farm&aacute;cia Popular</i> (Popular Drugstore), as 
  well as the changes in prices of goods and services and the income of poor families, 
  which may reduce or even eliminate the health expenditures to allocate them 
  to other goods and services.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  Besides, the higher absolute expenditures on the acquisition of these products 
  among the greatest consumers, i.e., women and older individuals, is coherent, 
  confirming the findings of the national literature.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inequality 
  in the income committed to the purchase of medicines was worse to the poorer 
  individuals. When the committed income was analyzed in at least 10% and 15% 
  of the total <i>per capita</i> income, the difference in the committed income 
  was 2.2 times and 3.1 times higher in the poorer individuals when compared to 
  the richer ones. This was also observed in the literature when the general health 
  expenditures were considered, with higher income commitment among women, the 
  poorer individuals and the older ones.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The higher commitment 
  of health expenditures can become catastrophic if the health expenditure represents 
  at least 40% of the family income after the payment of their subsistence expenditures.<sup>20</sup> 
  In a study conducted among 59 countries investigated in relation to catastrophic 
  health expenditures, Brazil presented the second highest prevalence of families 
  in this situation (10.3%), behind Vietnam (10.5%).<sup>21</sup> Of the health 
  expenditures, those directed at the purchase of medicines are among the most 
  significant.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  the present study and the representation of medicines in the catastrophic expenditures 
  show the importance of the State's protection against these expenses due to 
  the implications deriving from this process, like, for example, the non-utilization 
  or the underutilization of medicines, interfering in the possibility of adequate 
  treatment, cure, aggravation or health complications. The State's role refers 
  to the attempt to reduce the financial obstacle, minimized by the availability 
  or the reduction in medicines' prices. Also, there is the role of the prescriber, 
  who should consider the user's capacity to pay and the availability of medicines 
  in the public sector at the moment of the prescription.<sup>13</sup> In addition, 
  macroeconomic and social measures are fundamental, so as to impact the market 
  of consumption and access to goods and services, like better income distribution, 
  the access to public health services and general life conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studied sample 
  presents external validity for the adult population residing in the urban area 
  of Florian&oacute;polis. The uniform distribution of the losses in the family 
  income deciles contributed to this condition of sample inference. The distribution 
  by sex and age group was similar to the one found in the IBGE estimates for 
  the adult population of the municipality for the year of 2009.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The potential memory 
  bias involved in the self-reported data, like the use of medicines and the expenditures 
  on the purchase of the products in the 30 days before the interview can be considered 
  a limitation of the study. To minimize it, the interviewees were asked to provide 
  prescriptions, packages and/or the description leaflet of medicines utilized 
  in the past 30 days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the 
  high impact of the private drug expenditure on people's budget and the potential 
  of minimization of this phenomenon through the SUS, the better utilization and 
  organization of RENAME and REMUME might represent important mechanisms to reduce 
  private expenditures regarding the public policies, as approximately 50% of 
  the people do not use the medicines they need because they do not have access 
  to them through the SUS.<a name="topf"></a><a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> 
  Pharmaceutical policies that promote the rational use of the medicines should 
  be implemented, improving health assistance and reducing drug expenditures.</font></p>
