<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper analyzes 
  conscientious objection by physicians, through the concrete situation of legal 
  abortion in Brazil. It reviews the two main ethical frameworks about conscientious 
  objection in public health, the incompatibility thesis and the integrity thesis, 
  to analyze the reality of legal abortion services in the referral services of 
  the Brazilian public health care system. From these two perspectives, a third 
  perspective is proposed - the justification thesis, to manage the right to conscientious 
  objection among physicians in referral services. This analysis may contribute 
  to the organization of services for legal abortion and to the education of future 
  physicians working in emergency obstetric care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conscientious objection 
  is a formal mechanism for professional codes and public policies to protect 
  the integrity of people involved in a situation of moral conflict.<sup>8</sup> 
  This mechanism is utilized to protect individual values in a conflict between 
  public duties and individual rights, as in the case of the physician who declares 
  conscientious objection to refuse care to a woman that wants a legal abortion. 
  Conscientious objection protects the physician's moral integrity by authorizing 
  non-participation in a legally permitted procedure they believe to be morally 
  wrong although legal.<sup>8,9</sup> Recently, the fundaments of this right have 
  been discussed, regarding if it is absolute or subject to the rights of people 
  in need of health services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of 
  abortion in public health services, the conflict is not only between the physician 
  and woman. Conscientious objection can be analyzed as a conflict between professional 
  responsibilities and individual rights; between different individuals (right 
  to intimacy, freedom of conscience, autonomy, health, among others); or between 
  individual rights and institutional obligations.<sup>1,4,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article discusses 
  conscientious objection by physicians, through the concrete situation of legal 
  abortion services. The two principal interpretations of this framework are discussed 
  ("incompatibility thesis" and "integrity thesis") given the organization of 
  legal abortion services in Brazil. From these two perspectives, the "justification 
  thesis" is proposed as a form to manage the use of conscientious objection by 
  physicians in these services. The discussion focuses on the physician, since 
  legal abortion is considered a medical practice.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>LEGAL ABORTION 
  SERVICES AND CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, services 
  for legal abortion are referral units in the Unified Health System (<i>Sistema 
  &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de, SUS</i>) for the care of women in situations described 
  by law. A health service is recognized as a referral facility for legal abortion 
  through an institutional decision by the health unit in accordance with the 
  technical guidelines of the Ministry of Health (MoH).<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a><sup>,</sup><a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Services for legal 
  abortion in SUS were designed to care for victims of rape and women at risk 
  of death, two situations where the Penal Code does not punish physicians nor 
  women for abortion. MoH policies do not restrict assistance for legal abortion 
  to the public sector. Nonetheless, it is presumed that abortion will be performed 
  in public hospitals due the multi-professional team care model and due to Decree 
  1,508/2005, by the MoH, regulating assistance for legal abortion in SUS.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physician can 
  conscientiously object to a request for abortion, as long as it is not done 
  in disbelief of the rape, for example. Objection can only be motivated for private 
  beliefs, as in the case of religious beliefs. The physician cannot judge the 
  narrative of the rape, and the police report is not even necessary, since there 
  is a "presumption of veracity in the woman's word".<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  In alleging conscientious objection, the doctor solicits permission to not fulfill 
  their obligation. The woman is attended by another physician, referred to another 
  service or, in extreme cases, can be left without assistance. MoH technical 
  guidelines do not recognize the right to conscientious objection if there is 
  a risk of death, if there is no other physician or if lack of medical attention 
  harms the women, but recent cases reveal non-adherence to the normative criteria.<a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INCOMPATABILITY 
  THESIS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For Savulescu, 
  conscientious objection in certain situations, such as those previously described, 
  should be prohibited because it violates the fundamental medical responsibility 
  to assist patients with their health needs.<sup>7</sup> There is a medical monopoly 
  in the practice of abortion, including in Brazil, where according to the Penal 
  Code "abortion <i>practiced by a physician</i> is not punished" (italics ours).<a name="tope"></a><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a> 
  Therefore, refusal by a physician to assist a woman at a referral service for 
  legal abortion can constitute a definitive obstruction of the woman's right 
  to health, if there is no way to immediately substitute the health professional. 
  Savulescu considered countries with public health services. This is a specific 
  context for the discussion of the right to conscientious objection by physicians, 
  similar to what occurs in Brazil, where legal abortion services are organized 
  in SUS referral units and presumed to occur in public sector services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ethical rationale 
  by Savulescu is that morals have different roles in the public and private spheres.<sup>7</sup> 
  A physician should have the right to privately profess their religion or philosophical 
  beliefs, which can include political advocacy against abortion, but should remain 
  neutral when representing the State in a public health service. According to 
  this perspective, religious or philosophical freedom is subordinate to the duty 
  to care, and refusal of care can be considered discriminatory, immoral or illegal 
  depending on the motivations and consequences for the woman's life.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTEGRITY THESIS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other extreme, 
  conscientious objection is understood as an absolute and individual right.<sup>6</sup> 
  Not only physicians, but all people directly or indirectly involved in health 
  care could use conscientious objection to refuse to perform their duties whenever 
  their moral integrity was challenged by a woman's demand. In the case of legal 
  abortion, the integrity thesis ensures that physicians, psychologists, social 
  workers, nurses, pharmacists or administrative staff, each in their own role, 
  have the right to refuse care or provision of services due to personal motivations. 
  This thesis assumes an overlap between the roles of the health professional 
  and a moral human being; before being a physician in the service of State neutrality, 
  the person is a member of a moral community that determines their conscience, 
  including limits between what is right and wrong for medicine to perform.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The integrity thesis 
  has degrees of interpretation. On one side there are defenders of moral integrity 
  as an absolute right of physicians, to the point of argument that even procedures 
  such as informing a woman of her rights, another physician or about other health 
  services violate the individual integrity.<sup>6</sup> According to Pellegrino, 
  respect of one's conscience is a fundamental individual right and should therefore 
  be guaranteed by the health services.<sup>6</sup> In this interpretation, the 
  use of conscientious objection to actively obstruct a woman's right would be 
  morally justified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast, Wicclair 
  argues that from a principled perspective there is no contradiction between 
  professional duty of physicians and recognition of conscientious objection as 
  a right for moral integrity.<sup>9</sup> Brock, in turn, proposes three normative 
  criteria to protect the conscience of physicians. These criteria combine protection 
  of integrity and the moral obligation of physicians to women: relevance, referral 
  and burden.<sup>3</sup> Physicians can object to their duties because of relevant 
  beliefs but are responsible to refer women to other services, as long as this 
  does not result in significant burden to the women. For Brock, there is no reason 
  to assume that demands for conscientious refusal are insincere. Therefore, it 
  would be reasonable to balance these requests through a moral agreement with 
  objecting physicians on the three normative criteria. A conscience does not 
  only inform judgments about right and wrong, but also guides individuals to 
  not participate in acts discordant with their values.<sup>3</sup> This is how 
  freedom of conscience is interpreted for a physician to refuse to care for a 
  woman in a legal abortion service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proponents 
  of the non-absolutist integrity thesis, as in the case of Brock and Wicclar, 
  recognize the moral pluralism and establish basic parameters to regulate the 
  practice of conscientious objection so it is not understood as an absolute right 
  of physicians. A similar accommodation between rights and responsibilities was 
  proposed by the new Brazilian Medical Ethics Code, which recognizes the right 
  to conscientious objection, but imposes restrictions on its practice: the physician 
  "is not obligated to provide services that contradict the dictates of their 
  conscience or to whom they do not wish, except in situations where another physician 
  is lacking, in urgent or emergency cases or when refusal can harm the health 
  of the patient".<a name="topf"></a><a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> The Brazilian 
  Medical Ethics Code, like Brock, seeks to guarantee the right of conscientious 
  objection to physicians together with a normative obligation to not engage in 
  active obstruction to, for example, block women from abortion.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>LEGAL ABORTION 
  SERVICE AND SELECTIVE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physician, 
  who works in a reference facility for legal abortion, knows they have a responsibility 
  to perform abortion in legally permitted cases and that it is prohibited by 
  the Medical Ethics Code to "not follow specific legislation in the case of abortion".<a name="topf"></a><a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> 
  Participation in these teams results from an accord between institutional obligations 
  and the individual motivations of health professionals, and working in reference 
  facilities is not imposed on the physician. Respect of the physician's moral 
  integrity should precede their participation in the service: as a general rule, 
  physicians with <i>absolute conscientious objection</i> to abortion should not 
  be part of the reference services for legal abortion. The conflict occurs, in 
  situations of "selective conscientious objection", i.e. when the physician responsible 
  for care requests the right to refuse care in a specific case.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the 
  organization of legal abortion services in referral units means that the request 
  for conscientious objection by the physician is always selective, since attending 
  to women for abortion is part of their routine work. If on one hand the incompatibility 
  thesis subordinates the physician's freedom of conscience to their professional 
  obligation to provide care, on the other hand the integrity thesis is insufficient 
  to validate the reasons for which a physician refuses to care for a specific 
  woman in a referral unit for legal abortion. In this context, the integrity 
  thesis and an agreement with objecting physicians are still insufficient to 
  accommodate the physician's right to integrity and woman's right to health, 
  since it does not establish validation criteria for the relevance of a belief. 
  Reliance on the moral sincerity of the objector is insufficient for subordination 
  of the fundamental and absolute rights of women below the physician's moral 
  integrity.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>JUSTIFICATION 
  THESIS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The moral standings 
  of the woman and of the physician invoking selective conscientious objection 
  do not have equal worth. Frader &amp; Bosk<sup>5</sup> describe conscientious 
  objection as an "abuse of professional power". In Brazil, women depend on assistance 
  from the State for safe abortion, besides undergoing mental and physical suffering 
  due to the sexual violence or risk of death. In the latter case, delay in care 
  or refusal of treatment can cause serious consequences for the woman. In this 
  situation, there is no way to invoke conscientious objection without infringing 
  upon the normative criteria for burden, given the risk from lack of aid or the 
  risk of death to the woman. Requests for abortion due to rape and, more recently, 
  with judicial authorization in cases of malformation incompatible with fetal 
  survival, arouse conscientious objection by physicians in legal abortion services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For proponents 
  of the integrity thesis, requests to refuse treatment for racist motivations 
  should not be accommodated, since it is not a relevant belief and is illegal. 
  The liberal foundation of the integrity thesis does not discuss the relevance 
  of a belief beyond normative rules and accepts individual sincerity as sufficient 
  in regards to suffering in participation considered morally wrong. It is this 
  framework in which religious beliefs prevail as a legitimate and reasonable 
  cause to refuse assistance. The reasonableness of a religious belief is not 
  discussed during a request for conscientious objections, since its validity 
  would compete with the woman's right to health. The integrity thesis attempts 
  to resolve the conflict between the right to religious liberty and a woman's 
  right to health through a moral compromise by the physician with the criteria 
  for regulating conscientious objection proposed by Brock,<sup>3</sup> and incorporated 
  in the Brazilian regulations on legal abortion and in the Medical Ethics Code.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is critical 
  to discuss the place of religion and private beliefs in the public institutions 
  of secular states in order to regulate conscientious objection, especially given 
  the potential for invocation by all people involved in the health sector. The 
  interpretation of conscientious objection as a universal and absolute right 
  can destabilize the health system, through the constant risk of health professionals 
  refusing assistance. Nonetheless, for the sake of argumentative simplicity, 
  it is reasonable to assume that the physician who conscientiously objects to 
  all abortion would not work in referral service for abortion in SUS. Therefore, 
  it is the validity of the beliefs that motivate selective conscientious objection 
  and which should be discussed for the services to function justly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The logic of a 
  belief and the extent they determine the moral integrity of an individual do 
  not need to be questioned by an abortion service in order to authorize or not 
  authorize a refusal to care because of conscientious objection. Freedom of conscience 
  is an inalienable individual right, but its exercise can be regulated by the 
  State.<sup>4</sup> Conscientious objections is one of the ways to protect individual 
  liberty of conscience, but the moral reasons for which a physician refuses to 
  attend a woman should be evaluated by the State. The right to conscientious 
  objection does not constitute a free pass to refuse medical assistance. The 
  reason should be relevant, related to the moral integrity of the individual 
  and be reasonable within the bounds of human rights. The objecting physician 
  should justify the request to refuse care in a specific case; therefore the 
  "justification thesis" was proposed. The onus of justification is on the physician 
  invoking <i>selective conscientious objection</i>, and it is the responsibility 
  of the health unit to evaluate its relevance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The justification 
  thesis does not ignore the ethical and democratic fundamentals of the integrity 
  thesis, nor does it ascribe to the incompatibility thesis to regulate conscientious 
  objection. The justification thesis emphasizes that the relevance of the belief 
  should have a central role for the model of legal abortion in Brazil. By justifying 
  the way that care for a specific case violates their private moral beliefs, 
  the objecting physician makes their values public and submits them to an evaluation 
  of relevance by the health unit.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The right to conscientious 
  objection is not absolute, and its invocation should depend on accommodation 
  between reasonable rights and values for a just society, such as minimal risk 
  for the woman who seeks medical care.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article analyzed 
  the two main thesis on conscientious objection, the incompatibility thesis and 
  the integrity thesis, given Brazilian reality, and proposed the justification 
  thesis. The justification thesis allows for protection of the physician's moral 
  integrity but also controls calculated obstructionism and violations of the 
  woman's right to legal abortion. It is not reasonable to always accommodate 
  individual beliefs, especially when the right in dispute is the protection of 
  a basic need, such as the health of women.</font></p>
