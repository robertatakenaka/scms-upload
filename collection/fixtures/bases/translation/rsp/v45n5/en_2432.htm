<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professionals whose 
  voice is their work instrument, such as singers, fitness club instructors, salespeople, 
  telemarketing operators, receptionists, actors and teachers, are at a higher 
  risk of developing voice disorders. Teachers have a high prevalence of voice 
  changes when compared to other professional categories.<sup>25</sup> Voice disorders 
  affect work performance and effectiveness and they can lead to working days 
  missed, leaves of absence and even abandonment of work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voice disorders 
  can result from the interaction among hereditary, behavioral, lifestyle and 
  occupational factors. Excessive voice use in the workplace is a relevant factor 
  for vocal fold pathologies.<sup>7</sup> Disorders caused by voice use are characterized 
  as being chronic, which distinguishes them from other disorders that change 
  voice sound quality, such as laryngitis, flu, colds and acute inflammatory processes. 
  The dividing line between these two groups of pathologies is estimated to be 
  15 days.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of "vocal fold nodules" in teachers, as recorded in medical diagnoses, varied 
  between 12% and 13%<sup>1,6</sup> and it is associated with the length of time 
  working as a teacher, working in two or more schools, performing another paid 
  job apart from teaching, making an effort to speak, being female, shouting/speaking 
  loudly and weekly working time <u>&gt;</u> 20 hours.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among Spanish teachers, 
  the prevalence of voice disorders measured by laryngeal exam was 57.3%, of which 
  20.2% were organic lesions, 8.1% were laryngitis, and 28.8% were functional 
  lesions.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  aimed to analyze the factors associated with the prevalence of the medical diagnosis 
  of vocal fold pathologies reported by teachers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional 
  study was conducted in preschool and primary school teachers in the city of 
  Salvador, Northeastern Brazil, between March and April 2006. Data came from 
  the census conducted with the support of the City of Salvador Department of 
  Education and Culture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A self-administered 
  questionnaire was used, including socio-demographic aspects, teaching practice 
  aspects, work environment characteristics, general health conditions, vocal 
  health and habits associated with voice use. Questionnaires were sent to all 
  municipal schools in Salvador. Of all 4,697 municipal public school teachers, 
  4,495 (95.7%) responded to the questionnaire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dependent variable 
  was the self-reported medical diagnosis of vocal fold pathologies. The term 
  "vocal cords" was used in the questionnaire, as it is more popular than "vocal 
  folds". The expression "vocal cord pathologies" included lesions such as nodules, 
  polyps, edemas, minor structural changes of vocal fold mucosa and glottal chinks. 
  The self-reported medical diagnosis was used as a more accurate framework than 
  the indication of voice changes made by individuals themselves, because the 
  identification of vocal fold pathologies depends on a clinical evaluation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Factors more frequently 
  associated with voice disorders in teachers were selected as independent variables: 
  socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, level 
  of education and having children); professional activity characteristics (length 
  of time working as a teacher, weekly working hours in municipal public schools, 
  mean number of students per class, number of work shifts, performance of other 
  professional activities, working as a teacher outside the municipal public school 
  network and excessive voice use - speaking loudly and shouting - during classes); 
  factors associated with interpersonal relationships/work organization (specific 
  location for teachers' rest, continuous inspection of teachers' performance, 
  school management pressure, decreased teacher-student relationship quality, 
  good relationship with colleagues, sufficient time between classes for rest, 
  performance of activities without adequate materials and equipment, satisfaction 
  in the performance of activities) and with the work environment (ventilation, 
  furniture, humidity, chalk dust, microphone, excessive external noise, excessive 
  noise, acoustics, classroom size adequacy, dust, excessive number of students); 
  and self-reported diagnoses of diseases (respiratory tract diseases - rhinitis, 
  pharyngitis, sinusitis -, gastritis, hearing loss and common mental disorders).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following codes 
  were adopted: 0 (negative response to up to four factors) and 1 (negative response 
  to more than four factors) for factors associated with the work organization/interpersonal 
  relationships; and 0 (negative response to up to five factors) and 1 (negative 
  response to more than five factors) for factors associated with the work environment. 
  Common mental disorders were evaluated with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 
  (SRQ-20), developed by Harding et al<sup>10</sup> and validated in Brazil by 
  Mari &amp; Williams.<sup>14</sup> This version is comprised of 20 questions 
  to detect common mental disorders. Individuals with seven or more positive responses 
  were considered to be cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Variables were 
  statistically described and the prevalence of self-reported diagnosis of vocal 
  fold pathologies was estimated and compared among variables of the exposure 
  groups, using the prevalence ratio (PR) as a measure of association and respective 
  95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A logistic regression model was proposed, 
  adjusted for covariables of interest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The odds ratio 
  can overestimate the PR when the dependent variable shows a high prevalence.<sup>4</sup> 
  For this reason, the PR between exposed and non-exposed individuals was estimated 
  for each independent variable, adjusting for the effect of the remaining variables. 
  The 95%CI of the PR was defined according to the natural logarithm variance 
  estimate of the PR estimator, using the delta method and with the covariance 
  matrices being generated by logistic regression.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conditional 
  prediction method<sup>12</sup> was used to adjust the prevalence estimated by 
  regression, i.e. standardized reference values were selected for the covariables 
  to obtain an estimate of prevalence from the model which is adjusted for each 
  group of interest. In this case, the mean of each covariable was used as standard 
  value. As a result, the prevalence of vocal fold pathologies and PR among teachers 
  per category of each independent variable was specific for one category of the 
  remaining covariables.<sup>24</sup></font></p>

  statistics, the Hosmer-Lemeshow, Osius-Rojek, Le Cessie-van Houwelingen and 
  Stukel tests, Pearson's quadratic correlation and verisimilitude ratio coefficients, 
  and the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve<sup>11</sup> 
  were used in the analysis of the logistic regression model adjustment to the 
  data analyzed. Goodness-of-fit assessment was considered in a set of adjusted 
  values determined by the combination of values of model covariables (covariable 
  patterns). A covariable pattern is a combination of values of each variable 
  of exposure.<sup>11</sup> If, for instance, the model included the "sex" and 
  "hearing loss" dichotomous variables exclusively, there would only be four possible 
  covariable patterns: women with hearing loss; women without hearing loss; men 
  with hearing loss; and men without hearing loss.</font></p>

  the covariable pattern. Data were analyzed with the "R" software, version 2.6.1, 
  and the SPSS<sup>&#174;</sup> software, version 13.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Universidade Federal da Bahia Institute of Collective Health Research 
  Ethics Committee (Official Opinion 047/07). Each teacher received an envelope 
  with the questionnaire and informed consent form, with information about the 
  research and way to contact researchers, in addition to a letter from the head 
  of the City of Salvador Department of Education requesting the participation 
  of teachers and informing about the volunteer nature and data confidentiality 
  of the study. Teachers were instructed to return the signed informed consent 
  form and completed questionnaire in a sealed envelope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The majority of 
  individuals in the population studied were females (92.0%); with a mean age 
  of 40 years (standard deviation, SD: 9.4); with a higher education level (69.5%); 
  mean length of time working as a teacher of 14.3 years (SD: 8.45); and a total 
  of 20 working hours per week (53.3%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The medical diagnosis 
  of vocal fold pathologies was reported by 851 teachers (prevalence of 18.9%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bivariate analysis 
  showed that the self-reported medical diagnosis of vocal fold pathologies was 
  closely associated with being female, black (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>), having 
  worked as a teacher for more than seven years, working more than one shift, 
  excessive voice use (<a href="#t2">Table 2</a>), reporting more than four negative 
  factors of work organization/interpersonal relationships, more than five negative 
  work environment characteristics (<a href="#t3">Table 3</a>), one or more respiratory

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following variables 
  remained associated with the medical diagnosis of vocal fold pathologies in 
  the logistic regression: being female, having worked as a teacher for more than 
  seven years, excessive voice use, reporting more than five negative work environment 
  characteristics, one or more respiratory tract diseases, hearing loss and common

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the analysis 
  of the logistic regression model adjustment to the data analyzed, statistics 
  showed that this model was a good fit to the data, with a high level of agreement 
  between the frequencies observed and those expected from the dependent variable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The value of the 
  area under the ROC curve of the model tested showed that this model adequately 
  distinguished individuals with vocal fold pathologies from those without such 
  pathologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were 107 
  covariable patterns, totaling 3,993 individual records. The losses of this study 
  totaled 15.0% &#91;(4,697 - 3,993)/4,495 x 100&#93;. In the logistic regression 
  model diagnosis, none of the covariable patterns showed an influence diagnostic 
  value higher than 0.3, far from the critical value which, according to Hosmer 
  and Lemeshow,<sup>11</sup> is equal to 1.0. some covariable patterns showed 
  Pearson's </font><font size="2">&#967;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><sup>2</sup> 
  and log-verisimilitude values higher than 4 for covariable pattern elimination. 
  The value of 4 is an approximation of the 95 percentile of </font><font size="2">&#967;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><sup>2</sup> 
  distribution with a degree of freedom. The covariable patterns studied in terms 
  of the impact of their exclusion on the coefficients of final model covariables 
  did not show relevant differences.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of vocal fold pathologies was 18.9%, slightly higher than 13.3%, as observed 
  in another study<sup>6</sup> conducted in the state of Bahia. This difference 
  is possibly due to the more far-reaching question in the investigation. Teachers 
  were asked whether they had the medical diagnosis of "vocal fold pathologies", 
  while the other study<sup>6</sup> questioned about the presence of "vocal fold 
  nodules".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies that used 
  clinical evaluation of the larynx through the inspection of this organ pointed 
  to a high prevalence of visible changes in teachers' vocal folds. A study<sup>23</sup> 
  conducted in 1,046 teachers found a prevalence of vocal fold pathologies of 
  20.8%, similar to that observed in the present study, according to the self-reported 
  medical diagnosis. Nodules, polyps, edemas and cysts were found, among others. 
  Glottal chinks were observed in 70% of the teachers studied.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study<sup>7</sup> 
  conducted in 492 Spanish teachers using a video-laryngo-stroboscopic assessment 
  found an estimated prevalence of 20.2% of organic lesions and of 13.8% of vocal 
  fold nodules (20.5% in women and 3.2% in men).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Variations in the 
  methodologies used in different studies could contribute to the variation in 
  the prevalence found.<sup>16</sup> Comparisons among studies in the area of 
  voice are restricted to the variation in the definition of voice disorder and 
  in the measurement criterion adopted.<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profile of 
  teachers in the city of Salvador school network was similar to that observed 
  in other studies,<sup>2,3,6</sup> i.e. there was a predominance of females who 
  were married, had children, were middle-aged, had a complete higher education 
  level and did not perform other professional activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The self-reported 
  diagnosis of vocal fold pathologies was more prevalent in female teachers than 
  in male ones. Teaching is an activity primarily performed by women. Despite 
  the growing inclusion of women in the job market, their historical role in the 
  family has not changed yet, i.e. their responsibility for housework. The resulting 
  multiple roles create the so-called double shift: the professional activity 
  and the domestic tasks (as mother and housewife). This double shift translates 
  into an excessive number of working hours for women, contributing to the development 
  of diseases, especially those related to stress.<sup>3</sup> General health 
  problems and vocal symptoms in particular are more prevalent in female teachers. 
  This higher prevalence is associated with a lower level of education, compared 
  to men; a greater proportion of high housework overload; and a lower level of 
  participation in the decision-making process.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  social aspects, biological factors may contribute to the higher prevalence of 
  voice disorders in women. The hyaluronic acid, for instance, a protein that 
  attracts water to the vocal fold lamina propria, leading to a reduction in surface 
  trauma during sound emission, is more abundant in males. This could partly explain 
  the lower frequency of vocal nodules in men.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preciado et al<sup>19</sup> 
  reported that the clinical form in which voice disorders occur differs according 
  to sex. Nodular lesions were predominantly diagnosed in women who suffer from 
  major vocal trauma, as they have a smaller larynx and higher frequency of vibration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vocal fold pathologies 
  were more prevalent in teachers with more than seven years of teaching experience. 
  This finding is similar to what was observed in another study<sup>3</sup> with 
  teachers in the state of Bahia, in which the self-reported diagnosis of vocal 
  fold nodules was more frequent from the fifth year of teaching practice on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excessive voice 
  use was associated with the presence of self-reported diagnosis of vocal fold 
  pathologies. This behavior includes speaking loudly and shouting.<sup>2,13</sup> 
  Higher voice demand and the corresponding effort made to speak can be the main 
  causes for the onset of the first vocal symptoms, which would gradually shift 
  from temporary to permanent, leading to laryngeal organic lesions.<sup>19</sup> 
  Excessive voice use is characterized by an extrinsic muscular tension of the 
  larynx and repetition of vocal fold movements. Teachers are required to use 
  their voice frequently and intensely, due to the need to maintain classroom 
  discipline.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excessive voice 
  use, when maintained for many years of teaching practice, can increase the prevalence 
  of vocal fold pathologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The work environment 
  may contribute to the development of voice disorders.<sup>7</sup> The environmental 
  characteristics analyzed in this study included excessive noise, temperature, 
  humidity and dust, among others. Variations in temperature and humidity interfere 
  with the pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa hydration, causing the level of irritation 
  to be higher. The high level of background noise forces teachers to raise their 
  voices and increases their speech effort.<sup>22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Special attention 
  must be paid to environmental noise in classrooms. Case-control studies<sup>16</sup> 
  on occupational deafness showed a proportion of hearing loss of 25% in teachers 
  and 10% in non-teachers. Among teachers, the audiometric configuration of hearing 
  loss induced by high levels of sound pressure prevailed. Teachers reported excessive 
  noise and auditory complaints with frequencies of 94% and 65%, respectively. 
  Classrooms showed noise levels of approximately 87dBA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The noise emission 
  sources in the classrooms are the students themselves, when they speak or move 
  their feet or chairs and desks.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between vocal fold pathologies and respiratory tract diseases was significant 
  in the present study. These diseases result from individual predispositions 
  and environmental conditions. Larynx exposure to mucosa-irritating factors can 
  change the delicate vocal mechanism. For this reason, it is important to evaluate 
  the environment of professionals who use their voice to prevent this situation 
  from being aggravated, due to the presence of dust or mildew.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Work overload is 
  characterized by the excessive working hours and the several activities that 
  teachers are required to perform simultaneously: teaching, correcting homework, 
  completing report cards and class planning, among other activities, in addition 
  to the work they have to take home. Multiple responsibilities cause teachers 
  to experience physical and mental fatigue, which threatens their health. In 
  view of the pressures existing in the work organization, teachers can feel anguish, 
  dissatisfaction, anger, hopelessness, lack of motivation, tiredness and stress. 
  The presence of these feelings causes teachers to experience psychological suffering 
  in the teaching practice.<sup>20</sup> Common mental disorders, whether temporary 
  or permanent, can lead to absence from work.<sup>18,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between common mental disorders and voice disorders was similar to that found 
  in studies with teachers.<sup>1</sup> Gotaas &amp; Starr<sup>9</sup> reported 
  that teachers with vocal fatigue showed higher levels of stress and anxiety 
  than teachers without vocal fatigue. In a study conducted by Medeiros et al,<sup>16</sup> 
  teachers with common mental disorders showed 5.8 times more dysphonia than those 
  without such disorders. These studies suggest that stress influences the occurrence 
  of voice disorders. However, the mechanisms that measure this association have 
  not been clearly established.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the studies 
  mentioned<sup>9,16</sup> had a cross-sectional design, the possibility of reverse 
  causality must be considered: the presence of voice disorders could influence 
  the occurrence of common mental disorders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the limitations 
  of the present study is the way how the dependent variable was assessed, because 
  the self-reported medical diagnosis is a subjective fact. However, this measure 
  must be reasonably close to the actual phenomenon studied, as this is a large-scale 
  epidemiological survey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, there 
  are limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies. It is not possible to determine 
  the chronological order between exposure and effect. Data on the teachers who 
  were on a leave of absence could not be obtained, underestimating the actual 
  prevalence of the phenomenon studied, something known as healthy worker effect. 
  The possibility of occurrence of information bias should not be disregarded 
  either, because teachers who had experienced health problems tended to associate 
  more symptoms or characteristics studied with their work. The relevance of selection 
  bias cannot be fully evaluated, although the proportion of losses was relatively 
  low (15.0%) in the simultaneous analysis of all factors included in the assessment 
  made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More in-depth studies 
  on factors associated with voice disorders in teachers are required, aiming 
  to promote vocal health, especially structural changes in the work environment 
  and its form of organization. The legislation on occupational accidents' recognition 
  of work-related voice disorders could promote voice change prevention control, 
  the identification of initial symptoms and early diagnosis of these changes.</font></p>
