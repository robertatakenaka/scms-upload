<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To evaluate coverage by the Prenatal and Birth Humanization Program, according 
  to its minimal requirements and process indicators, by comparing information 
  from prenatal booklets to SISPRENATAL (System to Accompany the Prenatal and 
  Birth Humanization Program).<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A cross-sectional study was carried out with prenatal data from 
  1,489 women in the postpartum period after birth in the Brazilian Unified Health 
  System, between November 2008 to October 2009 in S&atilde;o Carlos municipality, 
  Southeastern Brazil. Data were collected from the prenatal booklet and afterwards 
  from the SISPRENATAL. Information from both sources was compared using the McNemar 
  </font><font size="2">&#967;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><sup>2</sup> 
  test for related samples.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Prenatal coverage in relation to the number of live births was 
  97.1% according to the prenatal booklet and 92.8% according to SISPRENATAL. 
  There were statistical significant differences between both sources of information 
  for all the minimum requirements of the Prenatal and Birth Humanization Program, 
  and also the process indicators. Except for the first prenatal visit, the prenatal 
  booklet always had greater frequencies than SISPRENATAL. The proportion of women 
  with six or more prenatal visits and all basic exams was 72.5%, according to 
  the prenatal booklet and 39.4% by the official system. These differences remained 
  for the five health regions in the municipality.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> SISPRENATAL was not a reliable source for evaluating the 
  available information on care during pregnancy. There was high adherence to 
  the Prenatal and Birth Humanization Program, but documentation of information 
  was insufficient for all the minimum requirements and process indicators. Ten 
  years after the start of the program, municipalities should provide adequate 
  quality of care and build health professional capacity for proper documentation 
  of health information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJETIVO:</b> 
  Evaluar la cobertura del Programa de Humanizaci&oacute;n del Prenatal y Nacimiento 
  seg&uacute;n el cumplimiento de sus requisitos m&iacute;nimos e indicadores 
  de proceso, comparando las informaciones de la tarjeta de la gestante con los 
  del Sisprenatal.<br>
  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS:</b> Estudio transversal con datos del prenatal de 1.489 pu&eacute;rperas 
  internadas para parto por el Sistema &Uacute;nico de Salud entre noviembre de 
  2088 y octubre de 2009 en el municipio de Sao Carlos, Sureste de Brasil. Los 
  datos fueron colectados en la tarjeta de la gestante y despu&eacute;s en el 
  Sistema de Acompa&ntilde;amiento del Programa de Humanizaci&oacute;n en el Prenatal 
  y Nacimiento (Sisprenatal). Las informaciones de las dos fuentes fueron comparadas 
  utilizando la prueba de c2 de McNemar para muestras relacionadas.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS:</b> La cobertura de prenatal con relaci&oacute;n al n&uacute;mero 
  de nacidos vivos fue de 97,1% de acuerdo con la tarjeta de prenatal y de 92,8% 
  seg&uacute;n el Sisprenatal. Hubo diferencia significativa entre las fuentes 
  de informaci&oacute;n para todos los requisitos m&iacute;nimos del Programa 
  de Humanizaci&oacute;n del Prenatal y Nacimiento, y tambi&eacute;n en la comparaci&oacute;n 
  de los indicadores de proceso. Con excepci&oacute;n de la primera consulta de 
  prenatal, la tarjeta de prenatal siempre present&oacute; registro de informaciones 
  superior al del Sisprenatal. La proporci&oacute;n de mujeres con seis o m&aacute;s 
  consultas de prenatal y con todos los ex&aacute;menes b&aacute;sicos fue de 
  72,5% por la tarjeta de prenatal y de 39,4% por el sistema oficial. Estas diferencias 
  se mantuvieron para las cinco &aacute;reas regionales de salud del municipio.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES:</b> El Sisprenatal no fue una fuente segura para evaluaci&oacute;n 
  de la informaci&oacute;n disponible sobre acompa&ntilde;amiento en la gestaci&oacute;n. 
  Hubo gran adhesi&oacute;n al Programa de Humanizaci&oacute;n del Prenatal y 
  Nacimiento, pero la documentaci&oacute;n de la informaci&oacute;n fue insuficiente 
  con respecto a todos los requisitos m&iacute;nimos e indicadores de proceso. 
  Posterior a diez a&ntilde;os de la creaci&oacute;n del programa, le corresponde 
  ahora a los municipios adecuar la calidad de la asistencia y capacitar sus profesionales 
  para la correcta documentaci&oacute;n de informaci&oacute;n en salud.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Prenatal and 
  Birth Humanization Program (<i>Programa de Humaniza&ccedil;&atilde;o do Pr&eacute;-natal 
  e Nascimento</i>, PHPN) was created by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in the 
  mid-2000s. The objectives were to assure universal access to quality care during 
  pregnancy, delivery and the postnatal and neonatal periods; reduce maternal 
  and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates; and complement already adopted 
  measures to improve care for pregnant women given the basic rights of citizenship.<sup>14</sup> 
  The PHPN established innovative quantitative parameters for a minimum level 
  of care, from primary care to higher complexity levels.<sup>14</sup> These minimum 
  requirements were early first prenatal visit, a minimum of six visits, tetanus 
  immunization, two routine sets of basic exams (including HIV and syphilis) and 
  a puerperal visit within 42 days of birth. The SISPRENATAL software is the information 
  system for the program available at each municipality. Process indicators were 
  created to monitor implementation steps and program continuity.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the PHPN, the 
  Ministry of Health recommends utilization of the following process indicators: 
  trimester of first visit; percentage of women enrolled in prenatal care in relation 
  to the number of live births; percentage of women with six or more prenatal 
  visits; percentage of women with six or more prenatal visits and a puerperal 
  visit; percentage of women with six or more prenatal visits and all basic tests; 
  percentage of women with six or more prenatal visits, all basic tests and a 
  puerperal visit; percentage of enrolled women with an HIV test; percentage of 
  enrolled women with the recommended tetanus doses; and percentage of women with 
  six or more visits, all basic tests, a puerperal visit, HIV test and recommended 
  tetanus doses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since implementation, 
  national data on the PHPN still show low coverage, with large regional variation.<sup>2,3,6-10,12,13,16</sup> 
  Although the number of women with six or more prenatal visits has increased 
  over the years, the minimum requirements have not reached 20% coverage, with 
  large regional differences.<sup>12,13</sup> All data from Brazilian municipalities 
  are inserted in DATASUS through local upload to SISPRENATAL. The program uses 
  collection instruments (enrollment forms and weekly spreadsheets), and information 
  should be subsequently transcribed. Any error in the transcription of data from 
  the prenatal accompaniment booklet to the worksheet and from the worksheet to 
  the computer system can result in incomplete or unavailable information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">S&atilde;o Carlos 
  is a municipality in Southeastern Brazil, with 193,000 residents and five administrative 
  regions for health (<i>administra&ccedil;&otilde;es regionais de sa&uacute;de</i>, 
  ARES) divided according to the geographical location of health care units. It 
  was the first municipality to adopt the PHPN, agreeing to the terms on 16 January 
  2001. The Municipal Secretary of Health developed a protocol for obstetric care 
  and also developed training efforts for the multiprofessional team in primary 
  care. In addition, specialized prenatal ambulatory care was created, and ties 
  to the hospital network improved, as represented by partnership with the only 
  accredited maternity hospital to the National Health System (<i>Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Sa&uacute;de,</i> SUS). S&atilde;o Carlos has high prenatal coverage and 
  low rates of perinatal mortality, in comparison to the mean for the state.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  Despite of this, the local program coverage has always been below expectations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recording and 
  typing of data for visits and other procedures performed during the prenatal 
  period present technical difficulty, since they are performed in S&atilde;o 
  Carlos by employees not involved in prenatal care. After attendance by a health 
  professional, data are transcribed to PHPN worksheets, usually by another member 
  of the multiprofessional team at the health unit. It can be assumed that information 
  recorded on the prenatal booklet and on medical records are more reliable since 
  they are performed during the visit by direct transcription. It is also reasonable 
  to assume that loss of additional information may occur on the worksheet and 
  when typing data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current study 
  aimed to compare prenatal data from two information sources: the prenatal booklet, 
  where all prenatal care should be recorded, and the SISPRENATAL database. Coverage 
  of PHPN was also analyzed, according to the minimal requirements and the process 
  indicators proposed by the Ministry of Health.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The target population 
  consisted of puerperal women residing in S&atilde;o Carlos municipality, who 
  had institutional deliveries and were selected following birth during their 
  stay in the institution. Women were excluded if they lost their prenatal booklet, 
  refused participation or had home delivery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A worksheet was 
  developed especially for the study, containing all relevant variables from the 
  information sources (admission records, prenatal booklet and SISPRENATAL) which 
  were initially submitted to pre-testing, and subsequently adapted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data collection 
  was performed in two stages. The first step occurred in the maternity hospital, 
  between 1 November 2008 and 31 October 2009, a 12 month study period. The minimum 
  stay for a woman in a maternity hospital is 48 hours. To include the total women 
  admitted for deliveries, the maternity was visited every two days to identify 
  study candidates from the report of deliveries in SUS during the previous 48 
  hours. Visits with puerperal women were designed to avoid interruption of other 
  activities (breastfeeding, counseling for discharge and for next visit, newborn 
  vaccination, visit of newborn in observation cribs or an intensive care unit).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data collected 
  from admission records and prenatal booklets (which are routinely attached to 
  each other) were transcribed on the data collection instrument.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After three months 
  of the start of data collection in the maternity, data collection began through 
  searches of the DATASUS database to obtain SISPRENATAL information, where were 
  also transcribed to the instrument. Data were collected directly from the computer 
  used by the worker responsible for the receipt and typing of SISPRENATAL data, 
  at the Municipal Health Secretary, Informatics Sector. This data collection 
  stage ended in January of 2010. During the second stage, the procedure for collection 
  followed the identification steps used by the health unit, typing the SISPRENATAL 
  enrollment number in the database, review of the name and date of birth and 
  transcription of the data from the information system to the collection instrument. 
  If the women was not found in the system, the search was undertaken with the 
  full name and date of birth; when these data were unavailable, the women was 
  considered as not enrolled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following analyses 
  were conducted of PHPN coverage: the number of pregnant women enrolled in the 
  program compared to the number of live births during the same period, obtained 
  from the State System Foundation for Data Analysis;<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  care to pregnant women in accordance with the minimum requirements of the PHPN; 
  and available information about the process indicators for prenatal care according 
  to Ministry of Health recommendations. Results were controlled for age, schooling, 
  marital status, race/skin color, number of pregnancies, clinical occurrences, 
  gestational age at birth, delivery mode, 5-minute Apgar, hospitalization during 
  pregnancy, referral for high risk prenatal care, and the woman's regional health 
  area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data-entry 
  program was developed in EpiInfo, version 6.04b. McNemar's chi-square test was 
  performed for paired samples, comparing the two information sources according 
  to the minimum PHPN requirements and process indicators, according to regional 
  health area. Pearson chi-square test was used to compare maternal characteristics 
  according to municipal regional health area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study respected 
  recommended guidelines for ethical research with humans. The research project 
  was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the College of Medical Sciences 
  of UNICAMP, appearance number 748/2008. Participants signed voluntary informed 
  consent forms, after being informed about the research methods, objectives and 
  justification.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Municipal 
  Epidemiologic Surveillance data, between 1 November 2008 and 31 October 2009, 
  S&atilde;o Carlos municipality registered 1,533 live births through SUS. During 
  the same period, 1,505 were admitted in the maternity through SUS, of which 
  1,489 were included in the study. Only 16 eligible women did not agree to participate, 
  and 28 live births in the public sector were not identified by the study, possibly 
  corresponding to births outside the municipality or home births.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least one prior 
  cesarean section was documented for 402 women. Anemia, arterial hypertension, 
  urinary tract infection and pre-term labor were among the most frequent problems 
  during pregnancy. Almost half of hospitalizations during gestation were for 
  urinary tract infections. The majority of women referred to high risk prenatal 
  care had arterial hypertension and/or diabetes. There were not a significant 
  number of newborn hospitalizations, in observation cribs or in intensive care 
  units. One maternal death occurred during data collection, but the study period 
  and the number of cases are small for inferences about this occurrence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2438t01.jpg">Table 
  1</a> shows the information obtained from the pregnancy booklet compared to 
  SISPRENATAL. There was a significant difference between information sources 
  for all parameters analyzed. With the exception of first prenatal visit by 17 
  gestational weeks, all other requirements had significantly higher frequencies 
  in the pregnancy booklet than in SISPRENATAL. The greatest difference between 
  the registries occurred in the documentation of routine second tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2438t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a> shows the process indicators according to information on the minimal requirements. 
  There was a significant difference between the two information sources, with 
  higher coverage in the prenatal booklet, except for gestational age of first 
  prenatal visit. Indicators that include information on the timing of the first 
  postnatal visit could obviously not be evaluated through use of the prenatal 
  booklet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maternal characteristics 
  are found in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2438t03.jpg">Table 3</a>, according to the five 
  different areas of the municipality. Regional Health Administration Area 1 (<i>&Aacute;rea 
  de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o Regional de Sa&uacute;de, ARES</i> 1) presented 
  a significantly greater proportion of adolescent pregnancies, greater parity 
  and lower cesarean rates. These same women were also minority white skin, had 
  lower schooling, greater proportion of births at term and more newborns with 
  a 5- min Apgar score less than 7, although the latter was not statistically 
  significant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2438t04.jpg">Table 
  4</a> presents information on minimum requirements, obtained from the prenatal 
  booklet and SISPPRENATAL, for each of the five regional health areas in the 
  municipality. The differences between the two information sources remained significant 
  for all requirements analyzed and all regional areas, with the exception of 
  first postnatal visit which could not be evaluated. Overall, prenatal care began 
  on time in all regions, with the lowest percentage in ARES 2 (67.4%), according 
  to the prenatal booklet. According to SISPRENATAL, the percentage of pregnant 
  women with six or more prenatal visits was similar in all ARES, with the lowest 
  rate in ARES 4. Nonetheless, in ARES 3, only 18.6% of women underwent all basic 
  exams and 50.3% underwent HIV testing. Also, in ARES 4 there was a lower rate 
  of women vaccinated for tetanus (only 66.3%, according to the prenatal booklet), 
  while all the other regions reached more than 80% of women vaccinated. Also 
  in ARES 4, a greater proportion of women performed all basic exams according 
  to the prenatal booklet (81.6%).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  this study reinforce the initial hypothesis of undernotification of procedures 
  in SISPRENATAL in comparison to those actually performed, as documented in prenatal 
  booklets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The minimal PHPN 
  requirements were adapted from international studies, especially World Health 
  Organization recommendations, although with a perspective to make them appropriate 
  to the reality of the Brazilian population.<sup>15</sup> Through SISPRENATAL, 
  the Brazilian Ministry of Health monitors performance of the basic program interventions 
  and provides financing to municipalities that meet these requirements. The availability 
  of financial resources for local investment is fundamental for the organization 
  of care and the quality of the health service.<sup>11,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, municipalities 
  from across the country adhered to PHPN,<sup>14</sup> although there is much 
  to be improved in the fulfillment of program goals. After ten years of the program, 
  low coverage of interventions persists, with coverage rates for all program 
  requirements under 20%, and with large regional variation.<sup>2,4,5,12,13,16,<a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd">d</a></sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the novel 
  aspects of this study was to evaluate prenatal information according to different 
  sources of information. Prior studies about PHPN coverage and process indicators, 
  utilized interviews with new mothers and/or review of patient records or DATASUS, 
  without consideration that the information sources could withhold differences 
  when compared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discrepancy 
  between the data from the two information sources on prenatal care in the municipality 
  revealed probable failures in recording. Prenatal coverage was greater than 
  90% in both information sources, although only 19.2% of women met all minimal 
  criteria, according to SISPRENATAL. The timeliness of the first postnatal visit 
  could only be evaluated through SISPRENATAL, since the information from the 
  pregnancy booklet was obtained during hospitalization for delivery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gestational age 
  for start of prenatal care was the exception in which SISPRENATAL outperformed 
  the pregnancy booklet, which could be explained by the municipal strategy of 
  timely confirmation of pregnancy through a urine test performed by the nursing 
  team. The health team is responsible for PHPN enrollment and for requesting 
  the first routine exams; the pregnancy booklet is only initiated during the 
  second prenatal care visit, when the results of the laboratory exams are available. 
  Another alternative or complementary explanation for this finding concerns the 
  financial incentive that the municipality receives from SUS in performing a 
  timely enrollment of pregnant women in the system. This could be a strong enough 
  motive to increase capture of these women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pregnancy booklet 
  is filled out during the visit, and SISPRENATAL relies on worksheets by the 
  health unit, after each visit. This method can create failures in documentation, 
  due to the details involved in the worksheet, sending the worksheet and in subsequent 
  typing into the system. Generally, the employee responsible for registering 
  information on the SISPRENATAL worksheets does not participate in the visits. 
  In the current study, the worksheets sent to the Informatics Sector of the Health 
  Secretary were always typed in the system by the same employee, who was accustomed 
  with the program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that 
  the prenatal booklet is more reliable than SISPRENATAL since it is less subject 
  to recording errors, it can be concluded that the municipality has quantitative 
  performance measures above the national average. In S&atilde;o Carlos, SISPRENATAL 
  was not a reliable method to evaluate information on prenatal care. There is 
  an especially large difference between the information on the second set of 
  routine exams. According to previous studies, the proportion of women that perform 
  the second round of exams is always less than expected and less than the proportion 
  that performed the first routine exams.<sup>2,3,6-10,12,13,16</sup> In the current 
  study, the decrease in the number of routine second exams was much less according 
  to the prenatal booklet compared to SISPRENATAL, which indicates that most women 
  meet this requirement, without a corresponding record in the system. A substantial 
  difference can also be found for tetanus vaccination according to DATASUS, which 
  reinforces the conclusion that integration between the multiprofessional team 
  is fundamental for improved documentation of information. In general, vaccination 
  is performed by a professional unconnected to prenatal care and on a different 
  day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Program coverage, 
  evaluated by the proportion of pregnant women in relation to the number of live 
  births in the municipality, was 97.1% according the booklet and 92.8% according 
  to SISPRENATAL. Although there was a statistically significant difference, we 
  can confirm that this program goal was met, since S&atilde;o Carlos presented 
  one of the highest prenatal coverage rates in the state. This fact can be explained 
  by early municipal adherence to PHPN and by the creation of a municipal protocol 
  for individualized care. The municipal protocol includes serology exams not 
  included in PHPN, such as hepatitis B, rubella and toxoplasmosis and a second 
  hemoglobin/hematocrit evaluation. In addition, the provision of care was organized 
  through referral mechanisms for specialized care and hospitalization and by 
  improving the technical capacity of the multiprofessional team through training 
  courses and workshops. Nonetheless, the correct recording of health information 
  is another goal to still be reached and is fundamental for the development of 
  new projects, understanding the target population and receipt of federal resources 
  by the municipality, in order to generate greater local investment in improved 
  care.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In comparing the 
  results of the diverse regions in the municipality, the prenatal booklet showed 
  greater notification than SISPRENATAL in all regions. Although the sociodemographic 
  characteristics may suggest that less favored regions have worse indicators, 
  this was not a rule. These regional differences, though, should have greater 
  importance for the planning of regional/municipal actions to correct distortions 
  that may exist in services provided by the respective basic health units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PHPN process 
  indicators allow for quantitative (and indirect qualitative) evaluations of 
  prenatal care, by regional or national level. The proportion of pregnant women 
  who meet the minimum PHPN recommendations can be determined, but the quality 
  of care cannot be evaluated through these parameters. As the name suggests, 
  the PHPN assumes humanized and quality care, to reach the goal to decrease maternal 
  and perinatal mortality in Brazil, although the causal relationship between 
  improved prenatal care and reduction in morbidity and mortality rates is questionable, 
  due to the observational nature of the relevant studies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHPN has new challenges 
  after ten years of implementation. There is a need for continuous motivation 
  for adherence and program maintenance in each municipality. Health information 
  should be made available more effectively through strategies to avoid data loss, 
  and investments are necessary to fulfill the initial proposals, including the 
  humanization of care. Pregnant women should be welcomed by the health network, 
  understand and be involved in care and create ties with the multiprofessional 
  team. They frequently report difficulties to adhere to the program due to inefficient 
  or impersonal processes at care units.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Correct utilization 
  of the available information would allow national programs to be developed considering 
  local and regional differences, ensuring improved resolvability, which is a 
  nationwide overcoming barrier to public health. In developing countries such 
  as Brazil, initiatives like PHPN can impact health indicators, as long as they 
  are customized and appropriate to each location. For greater effectiveness of 
  obstetric health policies, especially in the context of a developing region, 
  investments in human resources are necessary, along with financing to improve 
  the quality of care. The later includes the physical infrastructure of health 
  units, subcontracting of quality complementary tests according to strict parameters 
  and the establishment of connections between different levels of care. Human 
  resources include the technical capacity of the care team, from the receptionist 
  and the security guard to the nursing staff and physicians. The involvement 
  of the entire health team in meeting the implicit and explicit demands of the 
  population, in addition to correctly documenting data about prenatal care, would 
  represent fundamental changes in public policy. Eventually, decentralization 
  of the information system could reduce undernotification of procedures performed 
  during prenatal care, through online information systems for professionals providing 
  care in the health units.</font></p>
