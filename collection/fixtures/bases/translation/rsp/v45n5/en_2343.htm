<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To analyze the discourses of primary care midwives on access to and utilization 
  of the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program.<br />
  <b>METHODS:</b> A qualitative study was conducted in an area of low population 
  density with a high proportion of rural population in Segovia, Spain, between 
  2008 and 2009. Semi-structured interviews were carried out. Ten primary care 
  midwives were interviewed covering the 16 basic health districts of the city. 
  Data analysis was based on grounded theory methodology.<br />
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Access to and utilization of the Cervical Cancer Prevention 
  Program was associated with attendance to midwife visits, women's experiences 
  with cervical smears and their perception of risk of cervical cancer. Geographic 
  distance to the health center, difficult access to immigrant women who have 
  no health insurance, and being unaware of the program offered are some of the 
  perceived barriers. Social exclusion is also perceived as a barrier of access 
  to and utilization of the program. The recommendation to participate in the 
  program made by the primary care physician was identified as the main facilitator.<br />
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The midwives perceived inequalities in access to and utilization 
  of the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program that are associated to individual 
  characteristics of women, and contextual characteristics such as the geographical 
  environment where they live and Program's infrastructure. There is inequality 
  of access to care of underrepresented groups of women such as immigrant women 
  and those residing in rural areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cervical cancer 
  is the second most prevalent cancer among women worldwide. About 500,000 new 
  cases are reported every year, 80% of them in underdeveloped countries. There 
  has been a significant decline in cervical cancer in recent decades in Europe, 
  partly due to screening programs. In Spain, cervical cancer rate was 7.6 per 
  100,000 women in 2002. In the autonomous community of Castile and Le&oacute;n 
  the incidence rate of cervical cancer is different in its provinces, ranging 
  from 5 to 13 cases per 100,000 women and the mortality was 2.67 deaths per 100,000 
  women in 2005. The Cervical Cancer Prevention Program (CCPP) in Castile and 
  Le&oacute;n is a planned program targeting sexually active women aged between 
  20 and 64 designed to provide cervical screenings every three to five years 
  depending on the risk factors associated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social inequalities 
  are associated with unequal cancer prevention.<sup>1</sup> Studies on access 
  and utilization of cervical cancer prevention programs have been conducted nationwide 
  or region-wide but specific population groups that are quantitatively smaller 
  such as rural residents or immigrants are usually underrepresented. It could 
  be that information obtained from nation-wide studies mask situations of inequality 
  among women living in rural areas; the need to travel great distances to access 
  health care and working hours of services can constitute barriers to access 
  and utilization of CCPP services. On the other hand, immigrant women may have 
  to overcome barriers related to their immigration status, e.g., having no health 
  insurance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwives, who are 
  nurses specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, work in primary care in Spain. 
  In Castile and Le&oacute;n they play a connecting role between women users and 
  the CCPP as they are the ones who mainly collect and perform cervical screenings. 
  It is thus crucial to know midwifes' perceptions on the CCPP. The present study 
  aimed to analyze the discourses of primary care midwives on access and utilization 
  of CCPP services.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study was 
  conducted in the autonomous community of Castile and Leon in the province of 
  Segovia with 64% of rural population living in 208 rural communities and 17 
  local districts; 55.6% of these communities have less than 100 inhabitants. 
  It is estimated that legal immigrant population accounts for 13.1% of the total 
  population, and immigrants come mainly from Bulgaria, Romania, Morocco, Poland 
  and Colombia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Segovia is divided 
  into 16 local health districts (LHDs), three of them located in urban areas 
  and 13 in rural areas. Each LHD has a primary health care center where midwife 
  care is provided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fieldwork was conducted 
  between February 2008 and November 2009. A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured 
  interviews were conducted with midwives who provided primary care. All 16 LHDs 
  were covered as there were six midwives working in more than one LHD, with a 
  total of ten midwives working in the province of Segovia. We used an interview 
  guide to collect information on care activities of midwives, and access and 
  utilization of CCPP services by women users. All participants gave their consent 
  and the interviews were recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was based on 
  grounded theory methodology. Open coding was the first step, where key issues 
  were identified and grouped and labels or codes were assigned to them. Open 
  Code 3.4 was used in this analysis. Axial coding was then used to identify relationships 
  between the codes and categories of analysis were created.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The word midwife 
  is here used to refer to both female and male providers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All midwifes were 
  informed on the study objectives and gave their verbal consent agreeing to participate 
  in the study, which was recorded. They were assured that their opinions would 
  remain anonymous and confidential. This study is part of a large project that 
  was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Instituto de Salud Carlos III.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ANALYSIS OF 
  RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Factors influencing 
  access and utilization of CCPP services</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attending a primary 
  care visit with a midwife is a form of attracting women to participate in the 
  CCPP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Sure, they 
  are attracted because they come in complaining of itching or burning. Before 
  performing a vaginal test you go over their history and then ask: Have you ever 
  done a Pap smear?"</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Previous pregnancy 
  is a factor influencing access to CCPP services. Midwifes usually take the opportunity 
  during a postpartum visit to offer these women cervical testing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"(...) when 
  I provide them care during pregnancy, I schedule a 40-day postpartum visit and 
  then at this visit I schedule another visit for cervical testing</i>."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The midwives studied 
  have found that more women ask about the CCPP because of media information following 
  the approval and dissemination of facts about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"People are 
  now more aware of cancer, HPV, vaccines and such."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women's prior experiences 
  regarding cervical screenings is another influencing factor. The test is performed 
  with the patient in a gynecological position and women may feel embarrassed. 
  Midwives express the importance of making women feel comfortable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The whole situation 
  of a cervical screening test, the patient lying down on her back with her legs 
  spread apart and her genitalia exposed, and then someone places a speculum - 
  it is not at all comfortable. They fear being hurt, and I think that sometimes 
  everything goes too fast during these visits."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwifes' discourses 
  were varied as to whether women find it more comfortable with female providers. 
  However, they stress the importance of having a trust relationship with a female 
  provider.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"It is an action 
  in which women need to be relaxed and trust a little the person in front of 
  them."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When women hear 
  of someone diagnosed with cervical cancer in their social environment their 
  risk perception increases as well as their utilization of CCPP services. In 
  contrast, there is a low or no risk perception when they haven't heard of a 
  case of cervical cancer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... In these 
  villages women all know about each other's life, and as they haven't health 
  of anyone close dying from cervical cancer so it was not an obsession."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Barriers of 
  access and utilization of CCPP services</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The midwives perceived 
  "problems" to actively attract women users. They compared the CCPP with the 
  breast cancer screening program available and said the latter was able to attract 
  more women. In the CCPP the women are sent the test results and the schedule 
  for the next test. Some of them may miss the follow-up test as sometimes it 
  is scheduled within three to five years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"This is one 
  of the problems with the cytology program... the mammography program has a clear 
  schedule, they say when a woman have to do the first one and then repeat it. 
  The cytology program sends them a letter following the test saying that 'they 
  have to come back for midwife care within three years.' But they are not reminded 
  of it three years later, or five years later. It's a great weakness of this 
  program."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rural midwives 
  pointed that women living in communities that provide no health care and who 
  do not drive and/or have a car have difficult access to care. These women have 
  to rely on other people from their social network to attend a midwife care visit 
  because local public transportation is deficient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"... <i>transportation 
  is a problem for people living in the villages because they have no car to get 
  to the health center... many (women) have to ask their husbands to miss work 
  to take them to the health center, or they have to manage by themselves</i>."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another barrier 
  to access to care is the status of immigrant. Midwives identified differences 
  in access and utilization of CCPP services between immigrant and resident women, 
  pointing that immigrant women are reluctant to participate and that they have 
  low utilization of services while participating in the program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... the immigrant 
  population is more reluctant to have, for example, a cervical screening test. 
  They rarely use the program's services. If they use them for giving birth or 
  for any other reason, we take the opportunity to do a cervical test but then 
  it is not easy to make them come in for follow-up."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the midwifes 
  were asked why they think immigrant women did not use the services, they pointed 
  socioeconomic status of immigrants, having no health insurance and limited knowledge 
  of the local health system as potential explanatory factors. Many of them said 
  that immigrants living in rural areas come from Romania and Bulgaria and have 
  low socioeconomic condition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"They use it 
  in their countries, I mean that, for instance, Romania and Bulgaria provide 
  health care, they are not underdeveloped countries. The thing is that they say 
  the immigrants coming here are not middle-condition people but those with the 
  lowest one, and then culturally prevention and care are low..."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwives emphasized 
  that the longer these immigrant women are in Spain the more they know about 
  the health system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When midwives working 
  in rural areas were asked which they thought was a socially excluded group, 
  many said sex workers working in local roads. Their discourses show these women 
  did not use CCPP services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"It is impossible 
  to attract this group (sex workers). A few years ago we proposed to go and offer 
  our services to them because sex workers are actually a group at risk, as we 
  saw clearly they would not come in for cervical cancer prevention..."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwives said they 
  were not aware whether these women used private care services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roma women are 
  another group that has been historically socially excluded, and they are mentioned 
  in the discourses of midwives working in urban areas, where most of them live. 
  According to the midwives, they have low participation in the CCPP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Enabling factors 
  associated with access and utilization of CCPP services</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwives believed 
  that health provider's invitation of women to participate in the program was 
  a major enabling factor. Some of them said they actively attracted women by 
  advising them on screening tests offered in their services as opposed to a more 
  passive role of other midwives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  whether physicians and nurse practitioners provide information and advice to 
  women who are eligible to participate in the CCPP and refer them to midwives, 
  the discourses varied depending on each primary care team. Women are often referred 
  to midwife care when there is an active and effective working relationship between 
  primary care physician and midwives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The physicians 
  know exactly when these women should receive midwife care and they refer them 
  to us..."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other cases 
  there is neither referral nor a relationship between primary care physicians/nurses 
  and midwives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Physicians 
  and nurses in their areas do the uptake. They provide them information or this 
  is what they are supposed to do."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, sending 
  a personal invitation letter to women was identified as an enabling factor for 
  their participation in the program. They said that reminders were sent at times 
  but not consistently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... yes, indeed, 
  it depends... there have been times when they send letters and then stop."</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Primary care midwives 
  working in the province of Segovia perceived inequalities in access and utilization 
  of CCPP services that are associated with both individual characteristics of 
  women and contextual factors such as geographic area where users live and infrastructure 
  of services. The perceived barriers to access and utilization of services included 
  the need to travel great distances to access health care aggravated by deficient 
  public transportation. Having no health insurance and not knowing the services 
  offered in the CCPP have been identified as barriers for immigrant women. Social 
  exclusion of female sex workers and Roma women was also identified as a barrier 
  to access and utilization of services. Midwives pointed primary care physician 
  advice to participate in the CCPP as an enabling factor as well as sending personal 
  invitation letters to women targeted by the CCPP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study findings 
  corroborate other national and international studies that found the following 
  variables associated with participation in programs similar to the CCPP: socioeconomic 
  condition; education level; place of residence; place of origin; ethnicity; 
  age; risk perception; experiences related to cervical screenings; and cultural 
  aspects. <sup>1,2,4,6,7-10,12-15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  these variables, there is also evidence that women attending more cervical screenings 
  are those who use more health services.<sup>11</sup> In our study midwives said 
  that women who come in for a visit, especially pregnancy care, are offered to 
  participate in the CCPP. Thus, women who have barriers to access and utilization 
  of health services in general, defined by the literature as women of low socioeconomic 
  condition and immigrant women,<sup>4,11</sup> are more vulnerable to inequities 
  in access and utilization of prevention programs such as the CCPP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  midwives studied, women's experiences of cervical testing may be associated 
  with their utilization of CCPP services.<sup>5,8</sup> Negative experiences, 
  i.e., those associated with fear, pain and discomfort,<sup>3</sup> can make 
  women avoid doing cervical screenings. Midwives believed that to avoid negative 
  experiences there should be a trust relationship between women and their health 
  providers. It is critical to improve communication between midwives and women 
  users.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increased risk 
  perception of cervical cancer makes women use more CCPP services. Risk perception 
  is increased when women hear of someone diagnosed with cervical cancer in their 
  social environment, and have access to media information. Information about 
  the HPV vaccine in the media and the lack of consensus among health institutions, 
  professionals and authorities have indirectly prompted women to look for information 
  on cervical cancer in the media.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the main 
  findings of this study is related to barriers to access and utilization of CCPP 
  services. Midwives mentioned deficient public transportation from rural communities 
  as a barrier to access to midwife care. Rural women usually ask someone in their 
  social network to take them to the nearest primary health care center and this 
  person usually has to request a leave from work. Women living in rural areas 
  require special attention because of potential barriers to access and utilization 
  of CCPP services.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Midwifes believed 
  that immigrant women do not have much access to the CCPP. There is evidence 
  in Spain supporting these perceptions.<sup>11</sup> Barriers that may be causing 
  inequalities in access and utilization of services are related to having health 
  insurance and knowing the services offered in the CCPP. It is of concern since 
  immigrant women come from developing countries where cervical cancer rates are 
  high. Studies conducted in their countries of origin<sup>7,13</sup> have shown 
  that low utilization of cervical screening programs is associated with the fact 
  that women have to pay for this service. This is a free public service in Spain' 
  however, we do not know whether those immigrant women who have health insurance 
  are aware of that. Immigrant women living in rural areas may have a more limited 
  social network to overcome the barriers to access and utilization of health 
  services, in particular access to a primary health care center.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for enabling 
  factors associated with utilization of prevention programs, it was found that 
  health care providers, especially primary care physicians, have a key role in 
  advising women to participate.<sup>8</sup> Health providers should be aware 
  of their major role in the CCPP, and at the same time develop a good working 
  relationship in the primary care team so that women targeted by the program 
  receive adequate information and advice and can decide on their participation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not know 
  to what extent sex workers living in Segovia participate in the CCPP. Midwives 
  believed that there is underutilization of the CCPP in this group, but we have 
  no data to support this perception.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, there is 
  a need to further explore the causes of underutilization of this program among 
  Roma women as identified by midwives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comprehensive health 
  education campaigns can help increase participation in prevention programs. 
  In particular, immigrant women may be a vulnerable group. They should be attracted 
  through targeted health education campaigns rather than only providing informational 
  materials translated into their native languages at health centers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  it is important to reduce the barriers to access and utilization of CCPP services 
  perceived by midwives so that this prevention program could be more effective 
  for its target women.</font></p>
