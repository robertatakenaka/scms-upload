<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hepatitis C 
  virus (HCV) infects 130 million people worldwide, most of which become chronic 
  carriers. Hepatitis C is an important public health problem: 50% to 80% of infections 
  become chronic, which can lead to the later development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
  carcinoma.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HCV is divided 
  into six genotypes (1-6) and multiple subtypes, with variable geographical distribution. 
  Genotypes 1, 2, and 3 are spread throughout the entire world. Subtypes 1a, 1b, 
  2a, 2b, and 3a are found in Brazil, Western Europe, and the United States. In 
  India, Bangladesh, and other parts of Asia, genotype 3 is most common. In Northern 
  Africa and the Middle East, especially Egypt, genotype 4 is predominant. Genotypes 
  5 and 6 are found in specific geographical regions, such as South Africa and 
  Asia, respectively.<sup>1,2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, prevalence 
  of HCV infection among pregnant women appears not to differ from that of the 
  general population, ranging from 0.9% to 1.5%. Despite the relatively low risk 
  of vertical transmission, the lack of specific prophylactic measures justifies 
  routine screening of pregnant women for hepatitis C.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the 
  present study was to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection among pregnant 
  women, to identify major viral genotypes and subtypes circulating in this population, 
  and to estimate the degree of underreporting of hepatitis C.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We carried out 
  a descriptive cross-sectional study including 115,386 pregnant women seen by 
  the State Program for Protection of Pregnancy of the state of Mato Grosso do 
  Sul, Central-Western Brazil, from January 2005 to December 2007. This number 
  represents 97% of the pregnant women in Mato Grosso do Sul, based the number 
  of live births registered in the same period. Subjects underwent their first 
  serological test during antenatal care at the <i>Instituto de Pesquisa, Ensino 
  e Diagn&oacute;stico - Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais</i> 
  (IPED-APAE, Institute for Research, Education, and Diagnosis - Association of 
  Parents and Friends of Children with Special Needs).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blood samples were 
  obtained in health care units of all municipalities in the State by finger puncture 
  on previously identified filter paper. All samples were tested for antibodies 
  (ELISA) against the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Subjects whose samples tested 
  positive or indeterminate were subjected to further blood collection by venous 
  puncture for molecular testing. Anti-HCV-positive samples were tested for of 
  viral RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) using primers 
  complementary to the 5' noncoding region of the HCV genome. Samples positive 
  for HCV RNA were genotyped using the line probe assay (INNO-LiPA, Versant HCV 
  Genotype Assay, Innogenetics, Belgium), which uses biotinylated primers complementary 
  to the 5' noncoding region of the HCV genome.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other infections 
  such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, hepatitis B, HIV, human T cell leukemia virus 
  (HTLV), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, rubella, chlamydia, and Chagas' disease 
  were investigated simultaneously to HCV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects positive 
  for anti-HCV in the IPED/APAE screening were compared to those notified in the 
  database of the <i>Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o de Agravos de Notifica&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> 
  (SINAN, Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) as an attempt to estimate the 
  degree of underreporting of hepatitis C cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data were analyzed 
  using EpiInfo 3.4.1 and SPSS 13.0 software. We used the chi-square test to compare 
  calculated prevalences, assuming a significance level of p&lt;0.05.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study protocol 
  was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research on Human Subjects of the Universidade 
  Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul (CEP/UFMS protocol no. 488/2009).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of all subjects 
  tested, 124 were positive for anti-HCV, a prevalence rate of 1.07 cases per 
  thousand (<a href="#t1">Table</a>). Prevalence rates were distributed unevenly 
  within the state, ranging from 0.45/1000 in the city of Nova Andradina to 6.25/1000 
  in the city of Novo Horizonte do Sul. The cities with the highest prevalences 
  of anti-HCV were located in the center-south of the state, and all have populations 
  of less than 10 thousand.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2527t01.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevalence tended 
  to increase with age (p &lt; 0.001). More than half the pregnant women assayed 
  were in the 20-29 years age group, in which prevalence was 1.05/1000. Prevalence 
  was 1.94/1000 among subjects aged 30-39 years, and 2.97/1000 among the 40-49 
  years age group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The majority of 
  subjects positive for anti-HCV (53.2%) underwent antenatal screening in the 
  first trimester of pregnancy, 28.22% did so in the second trimester, and 5.6% 
  in the third trimester. This information was not available for 12.9% of cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 124 samples 
  positive for anti-HCV, 81 (65.3%) were positive for 5' noncoding RNA. Of these, 
  74 (91.3%) were genotyped. Genotype 1 (73.3%) was predominant, followed by genotypes 
  3 (24.3%) and 2 (2.7%). Of the 46 samples subtyped (62.2%), 75.1% were subtype 
  1a (25/33), 21.2% were subtype 1b (7/33), and 3% were subtype 1d (1/33); subtype 
  2a was detected in only a single sample; and 91.7% (11/12) were subtype 3a and 
  8.3% (1/12) were subtype 3d.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-infections were 
  detected in 13.7% of cases of HCV, the most prevalent of which was syphilis 
  (8.1%), followed by HIV (2.5%). Underreporting of hepatitis C cases in SINAN 
  was 35.5%, ranging from 23.1% in 2007 to 40.3% in 2006.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  is the first epidemiological survey of HCV infection in pregnant women in the 
  state of Mato Grosso do Sul to include viral genotyping. Global prevalence of 
  the anti-HCV marker was 1.07 cases/1000, similar to estimates calculated for 
  three municipalities of the state of Goi&aacute;s (1.50 cases/1000).<sup>3</sup> 
  On the other hand, prevalence in the present study was lower to that found in 
  subjects 19 years or older in a population-based survey of the Central-West 
  Region (19.0 cases/1000).<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly to a 
  previous study carried out in the Central-West,<sup>3</sup> prevalence of HCV 
  in the present study increased with age, the highest prevalence being detected 
  in the 40-49 years age group (2.79 cases/1000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Genotyping revealed 
  a predominance of genotype 1, followed by 3 and 2, and subtypes 1a (54.3%) and 
  3a (23.9%). These results are in agreement with the findings of studies of the 
  geographical distribution of HCV genotypes in Brazil.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-infection with 
  HIV was observed in 2.5% of cases, which is lower than the worldwide prevalence 
  of co-infection, which is as high as 6.5%.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevalence of underreporting 
  in our survey was of 35.5%. This indicates the presence of shortcomings in routine 
  HCV surveillance, which hinder the development of measures aimed at controlling 
  the disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The low prevalence 
  (1.07 cases/1000) of HCV infection in the present study does not argue against 
  the possibility of vertical transmission, and must therefore be monitored during 
  routine antenatal care. Moreover, the high rate of underreporting of HCV suggests 
  that the sensitivity of surveillance systems is low. Such deficiencies must 
  be promptly corrected so as to improve the foundations of programs for the prevention 
  and control of hepatitis C among pregnant women in the state of Mato Grosso 
  do Sul.</font></p>
