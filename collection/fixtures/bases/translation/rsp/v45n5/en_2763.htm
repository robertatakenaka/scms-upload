<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study aimed 
  to determinate the maximum daily peak of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> oviposition in 
  the city of Oran, northwestern Argentina. Biweekly samplings were taken between 
  November 2006 and February 2007 (spring-summer). The city was divided into three 
  areas (north, center, and south) and households were randomly selected. Two 
  ovitraps were placed outdoors in the selected houses. Ovitraps were replaced 
  every four hours, from morning (8 a.m.) to late afternoon (8 p.m.). The largest 
  number of eggs was recorded between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. (81%). These findings 
  enhance our understanding of the vector and thus its control such as spraying 
  during the hours of peak oviposition activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O objetivo do estudo 
  foi determinar os hor&aacute;rios de m&aacute;xima atividade de oviposi&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  de Aedes aegypti na cidade de Or&aacute;n (noroeste argentino). Foram realizadas 
  coletas quinzenais, entre novembro de 2006 e fevereiro de 2007 (primavera-ver&atilde;o). 
  A cidade foi dividida em tr&ecirc;s zonas (norte, centro, sul); foram escolhidos 
  aleatoriamente dez domic&iacute;lios em cada zona e duas ovitrampas foram instaladas 
  no exterior de cada domic&iacute;lio. As ovitrampas eram trocadas a cada quatro 
  horas, cobrindo desde a manh&atilde; (8h) at&eacute; a noite (20h). A maior 
  quantidade de ovos (81%) foi registrada entre as 16h e 20h. Esses dados aportam 
  conhecimento do vetor e, portanto, a seu controle, como, por exemplo, realizar 
  a fumega&ccedil;&atilde;o na faixa hor&aacute;ria de maior atividade de oviposi&ccedil;&atilde;o.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 2.5 billion 
  people in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are at risk of dengue. 
  Factors associated with the dissemination of dengue include geographic expansion 
  and spread of dengue virus and its vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and rapid increase 
  in vector populations resulting in a greater number of susceptible people, especially 
  in areas favorable for breeding, among others.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  In the province of Salta, northwest Argentina, dengue cases are reported every 
  year, especially in the northern towns of the province, where it is located 
  the city of San Ram&oacute;n de la Nueva Or&aacute;n, near the border with Bolivia,<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  where this study was conducted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is crucial to 
  understand vector biology, and thus daily oviposition activity of a vector. 
  The present study aimed to determine peak hours of daily <i>Ae. aegypti</i> 
  oviposition activity in the city of San Ramon de la Nueva Or&aacute;n, Argentina.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">San Ramon de la 
  Nueva Or&aacute;n (23&#176; 08' S, 64&#176; 20' W) is the farthest city of the 
  department of San Ramon de la Nueva Or&aacute;n and lies 270 km from the capital 
  city of Salta. This is a subtropical area, although there are one or two frosts 
  in July (winter season). Temperatures range from 11.5&#186;C to 44.5&#186;C 
  in the summer and -3.6&#186;C to 38.9&#176;C in the winter. The accumulated 
  annual rainfall is greater than 1,000 mm and average annual relative humidity 
  is 78%.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For determining 
  peak hours of daily <i>Ae. aegypti</i> oviposition activity samples were collected 
  fortnightly between November 2006 and February 2007 (spring-summer). For operational 
  procedures the city of Or&aacute;n was divided into three areas (north, central 
  and south) and 10 households were selected in each area with the use of a random 
  number table. Two ovitraps were placed in the selected houses. Ovitraps were 
  active for a day and replaced every four hours. Three timeslots were studied: 
  T1, 8 am to 12 pm; T2, 12 pm to 4 pm; T3, 4 pm to 8 pm) (GMT time zone -3) covering 
  from morning to sunset.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ovitraps consisted 
  of 350-mL plastic bottles (8 cm wide x 9 cm high) with a cylinder of brown filter 
  paper inside. They were placed outdoors in the houses, in the shadow on the 
  ground or at a maximum height of 50 cm. Both ovitraps in each house were placed 
  close together (maximum distance of 50 cm between them). Each contained 250 
  mL of an infusion made from dried grass mashed together in a water vial for 
  a week. This infusion is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
  as it provides an olfactory stimulus that attracts gravid females to oviposit.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  Each ovitrap was labeled with date, number and timeslot it was active.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We compared the 
  number of eggs recorded in different timeslots using ANOVA. To assess the assumptions 
  of normality and homogeneity of variance, the number of eggs "N" was converted 
  to Ln (N+1).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ovipositions were 
  recorded in all sampling dates, although at different intensities depending 
  on the timeslot. On December 7, 2006, there were eggs only in T3 (<a href="#f1">Figure</a>), 
  but eggs were collected in all three timeslots in the remaining dates. A total 
  of 385 eggs were collected in T1, 524 eggs in T2, and 3,902 eggs in T3 (81% 
  of all eggs collected). There were thus detected significant differences between 
  timeslots (F = 5.65; gl = 2:18; p&lt;0.05).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Nelson 
  (1986),<a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a> both blood meal 
  and oviposition by female mosquitoes occur mainly during daylight hours. Most 
  activity occurs in the first hours after sunrise, mid-morning and sunset hours. 
  However, Rodhain &amp; Rosen<sup>3</sup> (1997) reported that the biology of 
  these mosquitoes can vary depending on specific local characteristics. In the 
  present study In Or&aacute;n, daily oviposition activity of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> 
  showed a major peak between 4 pm and 8 pm. In a study<sup>1</sup> conducted 
  in Belo Horizonte, southeastern Brazil, during March 2002, oviposition activity 
  was recorded every two hours from sunrise (5:15 am) to sunset and during the 
  night. An increased activity was recorded during photophase (1:15 pm to 5:15 
  pm), while during scotophase an increased activity was observed during the first 
  two hours of sunset (5:15 pm to 7:15 pm). Although sampling started at 5:15 
  am, oviposition activity was only observed at 7:15 am (2 hours after sunrise), 
  and was minimal throughout the morning until 11:15 pm.<sup>1</sup> These data 
  are consistent with those reported in our study in Or&aacute;n, where most activity 
  was recorded in T3 that ended at 8 pm, i.e., half an hour after sunset (7:30 
  pm). Moreover, during the study in Or&aacute;n, when sunrise was at 6:45 am, 
  there was also minimal oviposition activity in the morning (8 am to 12 pm), 
  similar to that reported in Belo Horizonte.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies on the 
  hematophagous activity of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> conducted in Uganda, east Africa, 
  found activity in the evening (one or two hours before sunset). They also reported 
  a smaller peak, two or three hours after sunrise.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, a study 
  in Bangkok, Thailand,<sup>4</sup> showed a first peak of hematophagous activity 
  after 8 am, although sampling began at 6 am at sunrise in the city. The hematophagous 
  activity in Bangkok is increased during the rainy season, with peaks in the 
  morning, noon and sunset and few mosquitoes are caught after dark while during 
  dry seasons (cold and warm) there are only two peaks of activity (morning and 
  sunset hours).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local characteristics 
  and seasons can certainly affect both hematophagous and oviposition activities. 
  Therefore, knowing the oviposition activity of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> is important 
  from both a biological and an epidemiological perspective. Better understanding 
  the biology of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and the time of the day when peak hematophagous 
  and oviposition activity occurs may help vector control (spraying at specific 
  times) in cities like Or&aacute;n where dengue is endemic.</font></p>
